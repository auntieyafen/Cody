To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming (DP) to find the smallest possible weight of the last stone. Here’s the approach:

### Explanation of Approach

1. **Total Weight and Subset Problem**:
   - The problem can be reframed as a subset sum problem where we aim to split the stones into two groups such that the difference between the sums of these two groups is minimized.
   - We want to find two subsets whose weights are as close as possible, minimizing the absolute difference between their weights.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Target Sum**:
   - Let’s compute `total_sum`, the sum of all stones.
   - We aim to find a subset with a sum as close to `total_sum / 2` as possible. The reason is that if we can split the array into two groups with nearly equal sums, the difference between the two will be minimized.

3. **Using a DP Array to Track Achievable Sums**:
   - We use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` will be `true` if a subset sum of `i` is achievable.
   - Initialize `dp[0] = true` because a sum of 0 is always achievable.
   - For each stone, update `dp` to reflect new achievable sums by adding the stone’s weight to previously achievable sums.

4. **Finding the Closest Sum to Target**:
   - After filling the `dp` array, look for the largest sum `i` that is less than or equal to `total_sum / 2`.
   - The final result will be the difference between `total_sum` and `2 * i`.

### Code Implementation

Here’s how this solution is implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int lastStoneWeightII(std::vector<int>& stones) {
        int total_sum = std::accumulate(stones.begin(), stones.end(), 0);
        int target = total_sum / 2;

        // DP array to track achievable subset sums up to target
        std::vector<bool> dp(target + 1, false);
        dp[0] = true;

        // Update dp array with each stone
        for (int stone : stones) {
            for (int j = target; j >= stone; --j) {
                dp[j] = dp[j] || dp[j - stone];
            }
        }

        // Find the largest achievable sum closest to target
        for (int i = target; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (dp[i]) {
                return total_sum - 2 * i;
            }
        }

        return 0; // In case no valid configuration is found (shouldn't happen with valid input)
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> stones1 = {2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1};
    std::cout << "Minimum possible weight of the last stone: " << solution.lastStoneWeightII(stones1) << std::endl;

    std::vector<int> stones2 = {31, 26, 33, 21, 40};
    std::cout << "Minimum possible weight of the last stone: " << solution.lastStoneWeightII(stones2) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Total Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of all stones using `std::accumulate`.
2. **Target Calculation**: Set `target = total_sum / 2`, as we want the closest achievable sum to this target.
3. **DP Array**:
   - Initialize `dp[0] = true` to represent that a sum of 0 is achievable.
   - For each stone, update achievable sums from `target` down to the stone’s weight.
4. **Result Calculation**:
   - After filling `dp`, find the largest achievable sum `i` that is less than or equal to `target`, and calculate `total_sum - 2 * i`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times \text{target})\), where `n` is the number of stones.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(\text{target})\) due to the `dp` array.

This solution efficiently finds the smallest possible weight of the last remaining stone (or 0 if no stones remain) by minimizing the difference between two groups of stones.
