The given approach is experiencing Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) because it has a high time complexity due to the repeated `find` calls inside two nested loops. For each word and for each of its prefixes, the program checks if other words start with that prefix, which leads to an inefficient time complexity of approximately O(n^3) in the worst case.

To optimize the solution, we can use **Trie** (prefix tree) data structure to store all the words. In a Trie, each node represents a character, and by traversing down the tree, we can efficiently count how many words share the same prefix.

### Optimized Solution with Trie:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // TrieNode structure with count of words passing through each node
    struct TrieNode {
        TrieNode* children[26] = {};
        int count = 0;
    };
    
    // Inserts a word into the Trie and counts the number of words passing through each prefix
    void insert(TrieNode* root, const string& word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (char c : word) {
            int index = c - 'a';
            if (!node->children[index]) {
                node->children[index] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[index];
            node->count++;
        }
    }
    
    // Calculates the score for a word by summing up counts of all its prefixes
    int getScore(TrieNode* root, const string& word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        int score = 0;
        for (char c : word) {
            int index = c - 'a';
            if (!node->children[index]) break;
            node = node->children[index];
            score += node->count;
        }
        return score;
    }
    
    vector<int> sumPrefixScores(vector<string>& words) {
        TrieNode* root = new TrieNode();
        // Insert all words into the Trie
        for (const string& word : words) {
            insert(root, word);
        }
        
        vector<int> ans;
        // Get the prefix score for each word
        for (const string& word : words) {
            ans.push_back(getScore(root, word));
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **TrieNode structure**: Each node of the Trie stores an array of 26 children (one for each lowercase English letter), and `count`, which tracks how many words share the prefix up to that node.

2. **insert function**: Inserts a word into the Trie. For each character in the word, it traverses the Trie and increments the count of the nodes, indicating how many words share that prefix.

3. **getScore function**: Traverses the Trie for each word and sums up the `count` of nodes along the path from the root to the end of the word. This gives the number of words that share each prefix of the word.

4. **Main Function**: 
    - First, it inserts all the words into the Trie.
    - Then, for each word, it calculates the score by summing the prefix counts and stores the result in the answer.

### Time Complexity:

- Inserting all the words into the Trie takes O(n * m), where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of a word.
- Calculating the score for each word takes O(m) for each word.
- The overall time complexity is O(n * m), which is significantly better than the previous approach.

This solution should avoid TLE on large inputs.
