To solve this problem, a **greedy approach** can be used to build the "happy" string by following these steps:

### Approach

1. **Keep Track of Character Counts**:
   - Use the counts of each character (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and add them to the result string in a way that maximizes the length without forming "aaa", "bbb", or "ccc".

2. **Choose the Character with the Highest Count**:
   - Always try to pick the character that has the maximum remaining count, but ensure that adding it doesnâ€™t lead to three consecutive occurrences.

3. **Alternative Choices When Max is Unavailable**:
   - If adding the character with the highest count would create three consecutive characters, pick the character with the next highest count.

4. **Construct the String Incrementally**:
   - Repeat the process until no more characters can be added.

5. **Greedy Selection Using a Priority Queue**:
   - Use a priority queue (max-heap) to always access the character with the highest count efficiently.

### Code Implementation

Here's how the solution can be implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>

class Solution {
public:
    std::string longestDiverseString(int a, int b, int c) {
        // Max-heap with counts and characters (negative count to simulate max-heap)
        std::priority_queue<std::pair<int, char>> maxHeap;
        
        // Push each character count if it is greater than zero
        if (a > 0) maxHeap.push({a, 'a'});
        if (b > 0) maxHeap.push({b, 'b'});
        if (c > 0) maxHeap.push({c, 'c'});
        
        std::string result;
        
        // While there are characters left to process
        while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
            auto [count1, char1] = maxHeap.top(); maxHeap.pop();
            
            // Check if adding char1 will break the "happy" rule (three in a row)
            if (result.size() >= 2 && result.back() == char1 && result[result.size() - 2] == char1) {
                // If char1 is not allowed, check if there is an alternative character
                if (maxHeap.empty()) break; // No other option, we are done
                
                auto [count2, char2] = maxHeap.top(); maxHeap.pop();
                
                // Add one occurrence of char2 to the result
                result += char2;
                count2--;
                
                // Push the updated counts back to the heap
                if (count2 > 0) maxHeap.push({count2, char2});
                maxHeap.push({count1, char1}); // Put char1 back for future use
            } else {
                // Safe to add char1
                result += char1;
                count1--;
                
                // If there are more occurrences of char1, push it back to the heap
                if (count1 > 0) maxHeap.push({count1, char1});
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::cout << solution.longestDiverseString(1, 1, 7) << std::endl; // Possible output: "ccaccbcc"
    std::cout << solution.longestDiverseString(7, 1, 0) << std::endl; // Possible output: "aabaa"
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Priority Queue Setup**:
   - Insert each character with its count as a pair into the priority queue.
   - Each count is stored as negative to simulate a max-heap in C++.

2. **Building the String**:
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - Pop the character with the highest count (`count1`, `char1`).
     - If adding `char1` would result in three consecutive identical characters, we instead add the second-highest character from the heap.
     - Otherwise, add `char1` to the result string.
   - Update the counts and reinsert characters into the queue if they still have remaining counts.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If a character would cause three consecutive occurrences but no other characters are available, the loop exits.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log 3)\), where \(n\) is the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The priority queue operations (insert/remove) have \(O(\log 3)\) complexity as there are at most 3 characters in the queue.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for the priority queue with a maximum of 3 characters.

This solution maximizes the length of the string while ensuring that no three consecutive identical characters appear.


I am following greedy approach from https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-happy-string/discuss/564248/Python-HEAP-solution-with-explanation, here is my proof why it always gives the longest string.

The greedy approach is take "a", "b", "c" , always append the most abudant one to the result if not breaking the rule. I am gonna show you the result from this greedy approach either uses up all "a", "b", "c" which by default gives the longest string. Or if something left, that something must be "a" and the result must be a string with format "aa*aa*aa*aa*...*aa" where "*" is either "b" or "c".

Without losing generalarity, let's assume a >= b >= c, and we can look at the last two characters of the resulting string, it could be "aa", "bb", "cc", or something like "ab", "ac", "ba", "bc" ... which are not repeating.

At the end of the algorithm, there are x "a" left, y "b" left, and z "c" left. If the last two characters are not repeating, then this must hold true x=y=z=0, otherwise one more character can still be appended to the result. As x=y=z=0 this is of course the longest string we can get, so we can ignore these cases.

OK, here comes the hardest one, the result ends with "aa". In this case, obvisouly y=z=0. If x is also 0, we get the longest. What's remaining is to prove when x>0, the result is still the longest. I can show you when this is the case, the result must be some string like "aa*aa*aa*aa*...*aa" where "*" is either "b" or "c", so the result is always two "a" followed by "b" or "c". Why? Let's look at the string backwards. It ends with "aa", and y=z=0, so the third to last character, no matter it's "b" or "c", it's the last one of it. So for the forth to last character, as the greedy goes, we have at least 2 "a" left which is the most abudant, so the forth to last must be "a", same goes for the fifth to the last.
Wait! Why the forth to the last must be "a"? If its previous two characters are "aa", then it's forced to not be "a"? Good catch! But if this happens, the third to the last must be "a" since "a" is the most abundant. Contradiction! So the forth to the last must be "a".

And for the format "aa*aa*aa*aa*...*aa", we know 2(b+c+1) <= a, and when this is true, the longest string we can get is to use "b" and "c" to separate sequence of 2 "a", the longest we can get is 2(b+c+1)+b+c which is already given by the greedy approach.

For case ends with "bb" or "cc", it's impossible when a is the largest, following same logic for case ends with "aa", if it ends with "bb", the result should be string like "bb*bb*...*bb" which contradicts with the fact the result should start with "a" as a is the largest.

So the greedy always gives the longest string.
