Original code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumSteps(string s) {
        long long ans = 0;
        int n = s.size();
        bool isZero = false;

        int tempCount = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                tempCount++;
            } else {
                ans += tempCount;
                // tempCount = 0;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

The current implementation isn’t correctly counting the minimum number of swaps needed to move every `1` to the left of all `0`s in the string. Here’s a step-by-step explanation and solution:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Every `1` should be swapped with every `0` to its right.
   - We need to iterate from right to left, keeping track of the number of `0`s encountered so far. Each time we encounter a `1`, we add the count of `0`s to the answer because that many swaps are required to move this `1` to the correct position.

2. **Bug in the Code**:
   - The code increments `tempCount` when it encounters `1`, but this should instead count `0`s, as each `0` encountered indicates a possible swap target for future `1`s.
   - We should add `tempCount` to `ans` only when encountering a `1`, as that’s when a swap would occur with all `0`s to the right.

3. **Fixing the Code**:
   - Track `0`s with `tempCount`.
   - When a `1` is encountered, add `tempCount` to `ans`.

Here’s the corrected code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumSteps(string s) {
        long long ans = 0;
        int tempCount = 0;  // Counts number of '0's encountered so far

        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '0') {
                tempCount++;  // Track '0's
            } else {
                ans += tempCount;  // Add count of '0's for each '1'
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- Starting from the right end of the string:
  - For each `0`, increment `tempCount`.
  - For each `1`, add `tempCount` to `ans` since each `0` in `tempCount` would require a swap with this `1`.
  
This corrected code should now output the expected result of `6` for the input `"11000111"`.
