Your code can be improved in the following ways for better readability and efficiency:

1. **Avoid Redundant Checks**:
   - The checks for `n == 0` and `m == 0` can be removed. If `n` is zero, the function will simply return an empty string by default.
   - Similarly, the empty `spaces` vector can be handled naturally during iteration without any special condition.

2. **Use `reserve()` for Performance**:
   - Reserving space for the `res` string can significantly improve performance since you know the final size of the string.
   - The length will be `n + m`, where `m` is the number of spaces.

3. **Simplify Loop Logic**:
   - There's no need for an `else` block. Instead, you can handle adding characters more straightforwardly by incrementing `i` each time.

Here’s the improved version:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string addSpaces(string s, vector<int>& spaces) {
        string res;
        res.reserve(s.length() + spaces.size()); // Reserve memory for performance
        int j = 0, m = spaces.size();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (j < m && i == spaces[j]) {
                res += ' ';
                j++;
            }
            res += s[i];
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

### Improvements Summary:
1. **Removed unnecessary checks** (`n == 0` and `m == 0`).
2. **Reserved memory for `res`**, reducing reallocation and improving efficiency.
3. **Simplified loop logic** for readability.

These changes should make the code more efficient and concise.

### Time Complexity:
- **Original Code**: 
  - **Time Complexity: O(n + m)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `m` is the length of the `spaces` vector.
  - You traverse through `s` and check if each character requires a space to be added, which results in a complexity of `O(n)`. Additionally, each space insertion check is constant `O(1)` since you're iterating over `spaces` once.

- **Improved Code**:
  - **Time Complexity: O(n + m)**, the same as the original, with similar traversal of both `s` and `spaces`.

### Space Complexity:
- **Original Code**: 
  - **Space Complexity: O(n + m)**.
  - Creating a new result string that contains `n` characters and possibly `m` additional spaces results in `O(n + m)`.

- **Improved Code**:
  - **Space Complexity: O(n + m)**, for the newly created string.
  - Using `reserve()` helps reduce the number of memory reallocations, but it doesn’t change the asymptotic space complexity.

Overall, the improved version maintains the same time and space complexity as the original, but it is more efficient in practice due to fewer memory allocations when using `reserve()`.
