The **lexical order** (also known as lexicographical order) refers to the order in which words or sequences are arranged based on dictionary order, typically used for comparing strings. In terms of numbers, it means that the numbers are ordered as if they were strings.

For example, the lexicographical order of numbers from `1` to `13` would be:

```
1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
```

This is because in lexical ordering, numbers are treated like strings, so `"10"` comes before `"2"` just as `"apple"` comes before `"banana"` in a dictionary.

### Problem: Generating Lexicographical Order for Numbers

Given an integer `n`, return all the numbers from `1` to `n` in lexicographical order.

### Approach

You can solve this problem by using a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** strategy, where you try to generate the next valid number in lexical order by trying each digit (`0` to `9`) and recursively building the next valid number.

Here’s how to generate the list of numbers in lexicographical order:

### Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        vector<int> result;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {
            dfs(i, n, result);
        }
        return result;
    }
    
private:
    void dfs(int cur, int n, vector<int>& result) {
        if (cur > n) return;
        
        result.push_back(cur);
        for (int i = 0; i <= 9; ++i) {
            int next = cur * 10 + i;
            if (next > n) return;
            dfs(next, n, result);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Loop (Lines 4-6)**: We start by calling DFS for the numbers `1` to `9`. These are the possible starting digits for a lexicographically ordered list.

2. **DFS Recursive Function (Lines 10-16)**:
    - **Base Case**: If `cur` (the current number being generated) exceeds `n`, we return to stop further recursion.
    - **Push Current Number**: We add the current number to the result.
    - **Recursion**: For each digit `0` to `9`, we attempt to append the digit to the current number and recursively call DFS. This builds the next valid number in lexicographical order.
    - **Pruning**: If the next number exceeds `n`, we stop further recursion.

### Example:

For `n = 13`, the algorithm would generate:

```
1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity is **O(n)** since we are generating each number exactly once and making a constant amount of work for each number.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is **O(n)**, primarily due to the result vector and the recursion stack.


//////////////////////////

The **lexicographical order** problem for numbers from `1` to `n` is already efficiently solved using the DFS approach, as described previously. The DFS solution ensures that every number is generated once, and it explores only the valid numbers in lexicographical order without sorting or creating intermediate lists. As a result, the time complexity of **O(n)** and space complexity of **O(n)** are optimal in most cases.

Given the constraints of the problem, this approach is already one of the fastest ways to solve it. However, there are a few considerations that can optimize or tweak the solution for slight performance improvements:

### Potential Tweaks:

1. **Iterative Approach Instead of Recursion**: Although DFS recursion works well for this problem, recursion can cause stack overflows for very large `n`. Converting the DFS into an iterative approach using a stack (to simulate recursion) can help avoid recursion depth issues and potentially reduce overhead.
   
   Here’s an iterative version of the DFS approach:

   ```cpp
   class Solution {
   public:
       vector<int> lexicalOrder(int n) {
           vector<int> result;
           int current = 1;
           
           for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
               result.push_back(current);
               if (current * 10 <= n) {
                   current *= 10;  // Move to next level (e.g., 1 -> 10)
               } else {
                   while (current % 10 == 9 || current + 1 > n) {
                       current /= 10;  // Backtrack to the next possible number
                   }
                   current++;
               }
           }
           return result;
       }
   };
   ```

   ### Explanation:

   - Start with `current = 1`.
   - Try to go deeper by multiplying `current` by 10 (e.g., from 1 to 10).
   - If going deeper exceeds `n`, backtrack and increment (e.g., from `19` back to `2`).
   - This process eliminates recursion overhead and handles cases where `n` is large.

2. **Avoiding String Manipulation**: The solution doesn't use string comparisons or conversions, which is good for performance. Sorting a list of numbers after converting them to strings would have higher time complexity (**O(n log n)**), so we avoid that here.

3. **Practical Limitations**: The solution is already optimal for generating all numbers from `1` to `n` in lexicographical order. There’s no sorting or redundant checks, and each number is processed exactly once.

### Time Complexity:

- The iterative solution still has a time complexity of **O(n)**, as we are generating each number in the range from `1` to `n` once.
  
- The space complexity remains **O(n)** due to the result array.

### Summary:

- The DFS-based solution (either recursive or iterative) is likely the best approach for this problem in terms of time complexity.
- Further improvements or optimizations are unlikely to significantly reduce the time complexity beyond **O(n)**, as every number in the range needs to be processed.
