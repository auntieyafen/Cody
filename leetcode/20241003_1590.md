### Problem Explanation:
The task is to find the minimum length of a subarray that, when removed from the array `nums`, makes the sum of the remaining elements divisible by `p`.

### Solution Breakdown:
1. **Total Sum Calculation**:
   - First, compute the sum of all elements in `nums`.
   - Find the remainder (`target = sum % p`). This is the amount by which the total sum differs from the next multiple of `p`.
   - If `target == 0`, the total sum is already divisible by `p`, and we can return 0 (no subarray needs to be removed).

2. **Prefix Sum with Modulo**:
   - As we traverse the array, we compute a prefix sum modulo `p`. Let's call this `currentSum % p`.
   - For each prefix sum, we want to find if there was any previous prefix sum such that removing the subarray between the current position and that previous position would make the total sum divisible by `p`.
   - This is equivalent to checking if the difference between the `currentSum % p` and the `target` matches a previously seen prefix sum.

3. **Using a HashMap**:
   - We use a hash map (`prefixSum`) to store the modulo `p` values of prefix sums we've encountered so far. The key is the prefix sum modulo `p`, and the value is the index where that prefix sum was found.
   - If we find a `complement = (currentSum - target + p) % p` that exists in the hash map, it means removing the subarray between that previously seen index and the current index will adjust the sum by exactly `target`, making the new total divisible by `p`.
   - We keep track of the minimum length of such subarrays.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - If we can't find any subarray that satisfies the condition, return `-1`.

### Optimized Approach:

- **Time Complexity**: The solution runs in O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, because we traverse the array once and use a hash map for constant-time lookups and insertions.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) due to the hash map storing prefix sums.

### Code Walkthrough:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int p) {
        long long sum = 0;
        
        // Calculate the total sum of the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
        }
        
        // The remainder when dividing the sum by p (this is what we need to eliminate)
        int target = sum % p;
        
        // If the total sum is already divisible by p, no subarray needs to be removed
        if (target == 0) return 0;
        
        // Hash map to store the prefix sum modulo p and its index
        unordered_map<int, int> prefixSum;
        prefixSum[0] = -1;  // Prefix sum of 0 before the array starts
        
        int currentSum = 0;
        int minLength = nums.size();  // Initialize with max possible length
        
        // Iterate through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            // Update the current prefix sum modulo p
            currentSum = (currentSum + nums[i]) % p;
            
            // The complement we need to find in the prefix sums
            int complement = (currentSum - target + p) % p;
            
            // If the complement exists in the hash map, calculate the subarray length
            if (prefixSum.find(complement) != prefixSum.end()) {
                minLength = min(minLength, i - prefixSum[complement]);
            }
            
            // Store the current prefix sum modulo p and its index
            prefixSum[currentSum] = i;
        }
        
        // If we found a valid subarray, return its length; otherwise, return -1
        return minLength < nums.size() ? minLength : -1;
    }
};
```

### Key Points:

- **Prefix Sums with Modulo**: Using prefix sums combined with modulo arithmetic helps in efficiently tracking cumulative sums and determining whether removing a subarray can make the remaining sum divisible by `p`.
- **Handling Negatives in Modulo**: `(currentSum - target + p) % p` ensures that we always have a non-negative value when computing the complement.
- **HashMap for Constant-Time Lookups**: The unordered map stores the prefix sums for efficient lookups, avoiding a brute force approach that would result in time complexity of O(nÂ²).

### Further Optimizations:
This is an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n). There isn't much room for further optimization unless there are specific constraints (like very small `p` values or additional structure in the input) that allow for domain-specific tricks.
