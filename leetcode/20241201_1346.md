Let's compare the time and space complexities for both versions of the code:

### Your Original Code Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - `O(n)` for the initial loop to populate `arrMap`.
  - `O(n)` for the loop that checks the conditions.
  - Therefore, the total time complexity is `O(n)` + `O(n)` = `O(n)`.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The unordered map (`arrMap`) has an `O(n)` space complexity for storing counts of elements in the array.

### My Improved Code Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - The code iterates through the list once and checks for conditions using an unordered set, making the complexity `O(n)`.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The unordered set (`seen`) takes `O(n)` space for storing unique elements.

### Summary of Comparison
- **Time Complexity**: Both codes have a time complexity of `O(n)`, as they iterate through the input array twice.
- **Space Complexity**: Both codes use additional space for storing elements (`O(n)`).
  
However, the improved version is more efficient in practice:
1. It eliminates redundant checks.
2. Uses an unordered set, which leads to simpler code.
3. The logic is streamlined for readability, leading to fewer operations.
