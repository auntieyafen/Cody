To remove the nth node from the end of the linked list, you can use a two-pointer technique. This approach will allow you to solve the problem in a single pass through the list. Here is the implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        // Create a dummy node that points to the head, in case we need to remove the first node.
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
        
        // Initialize two pointers, `first` and `second`, both starting from `dummy`.
        ListNode* first = dummy;
        ListNode* second = dummy;

        // Move the `first` pointer n+1 steps ahead to create a gap of n nodes between `first` and `second`.
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
            first = first->next;
        }

        // Move `first` to the end, maintaining the gap between `first` and `second`.
        while (first != nullptr) {
            first = first->next;
            second = second->next;
        }

        // `second` is now just before the node to be deleted.
        second->next = second->next->next;

        // Return the updated head, which is `dummy->next`.
        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Dummy Node**: A dummy node is added before the head to simplify edge cases, such as when the head itself needs to be removed.
2. **Two Pointers**: 
   - `first` and `second` both start from the dummy node.
   - Move `first` pointer n+1 steps forward, so the distance between `first` and `second` is n nodes.
   - Move `first` and `second` pointers simultaneously until `first` reaches the end of the list.
   - At this point, `second` is pointing to the node just before the one that needs to be removed.
3. **Removal**: Update `second->next` to skip the node that needs to be deleted.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list, since we traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use only a constant amount of extra space.

This solution is efficient, easy to understand, and handles all edge cases effectively.
