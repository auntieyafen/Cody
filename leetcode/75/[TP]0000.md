### Key Improvements and Changes:
1. **Removed Templates**: The code now works with `std::string` rather than being a templated solution, making it suitable for the given problem with tasks represented as strings.

2. **Variable Names**: The variable names have been made more descriptive to make the code easier to understand.

3. **Exception Handling**: If the graph contains a cycle (which should not happen since the problem guarantees a solution), the code throws an exception.

### How the Code Works:
- **find_indegree()**: This function computes the in-degree of each task. In-degree represents the number of prerequisites for each task.
- **topo_sort()**: Performs topological sorting to generate a valid task ordering based on the given requirements.
- **task_scheduling()**: Constructs the graph of tasks and uses `topo_sort()` to determine the valid sequence in which tasks can be performed.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of tasks (nodes) and `E` is the number of requirements (edges).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(V + E)` due to storing the graph representation and the in-degree of each node.

The line `graph[task] = {};` initializes an empty list (vector) of neighbors for each task in the graph. Essentially, this line ensures that every task is represented in the graph, even if it doesn't have any dependencies or tasks that depend on it.

In `std::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>>`, the `graph` maps each task (`task` is a string) to a list of tasks (neighbors) that come after it. The `{}` initializes the value for `task` as an empty vector, indicating no neighbors initially.
