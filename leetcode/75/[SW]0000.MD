Here is a sliding window solution for the given problem that operates in `O(N)` complexity. It maintains three sliding windows on each of the three arrays to find the valid triplets. This solution also uses the concept of maintaining ranges to keep all differences under `D`.

The above solution uses a sliding window approach with three pointers (`i`, `j`, `k`) to efficiently iterate through the three sorted arrays (`arr1`, `arr2`, and `arr3`). The code checks if each triplet satisfies the condition and adjusts the pointers accordingly to cover all possible valid combinations.

### Improvements in the Code:
1. **Optimized Sliding Window**:
   - Each time a valid triplet is found, the code calculates the number of possible combinations.
   - Instead of iterating through each possibility manually, the ranges are considered using sliding window increments.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of the arrays. Each array is iterated over linearly.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (excluding the input arrays). No extra space is required beyond a few variables. 

This solution should efficiently meet the problem's requirements and handle large input sizes.

I'll provide an efficient solution to find the number of valid tuples from three sorted arrays, where the constraints are given by `|A[i]-B[j]| <= D`, `|B[j]-C[k]| <= D`, and `|A[i]-C[k]| <= D`. We'll use a sliding window approach to achieve the required time complexity.

### Solution Approach in C++

The idea is to use a combination of sliding window techniques to efficiently count the number of valid tuples. The solution below uses a `two-pointer` approach to calculate the possible number of valid pairs and satisfy the conditions.

The code provided is a C++ implementation using the sliding window approach. Let's walk through how it works:

### Steps:
1. Iterate through the first array, `A`.
2. Use two pointers `j` and `k` for arrays `B` and `C` respectively.
3. For each element in `A`, advance pointers in `B` and `C` to find valid combinations that meet the given conditions.
4. Count the valid tuples accordingly.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the size of each array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), no extra space is used. 

This solution is efficient for arrays of moderate size, leveraging a combination of binary search and sliding window.
