Once you finish playing around with the examples given to you, you might notice that for any "node" at position `triangle[i][j]`, the left branch is `triangle[i+1][j]` and the right branch is `triangle[i+1][j+1]`. 

### Solution 1: Recursion without Memoization

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTotal(vector<vector<int>>& triangle) {
        return min_path_sum(triangle, 0, 0);
    }
    
private:
    int min_path_sum(vector<vector<int>>& triangle, int row, int col) {
        if (row == triangle.size()) {
            return 0;
        }
        int left_sum = min_path_sum(triangle, row + 1, col);
        int right_sum = min_path_sum(triangle, row + 1, col + 1);
        return triangle[row][col] + min(left_sum, right_sum);
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity: O(2^n)**

- This is because for each element, we have two recursive calls — either to the left or right child.
- Since the height of the triangle is `n`, there are approximately `2^n` function calls in the worst case.
  
**Space Complexity: O(n)**

- The space complexity comes from the maximum depth of the recursive call stack, which is equal to the height `n` of the triangle.

**Analysis**:

- This solution is extremely inefficient as it involves recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

### Solution 2: Top-Down Recursion with Memoization

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& triangle, int level, int column, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& memo) {
    if (level == triangle.size()) return 0;
    if (memo[level][column] != std::numeric_limits<int>::max()) {
        return memo[level][column];
    }
    int left = dfs(triangle, level + 1, column, memo);
    int right = dfs(triangle, level + 1, column + 1, memo);
    memo[level][column] = std::min(left, right) + triangle[level][column];
    return memo[level][column];
}

int minimumTotal(std::vector<std::vector<int>> triangle) {
    int n = triangle.size();
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> memo(n, std::vector<int>(n, std::numeric_limits<int>::max()));
    return dfs(triangle, 0, 0, memo);
}
};
```

**Time Complexity: O(n^2)**

- Since we only compute each subproblem once and store the result in the `memo` table, each recursive call has a complexity of `O(1)`, and we do `n^2` recursive calls.
  
**Space Complexity: O(n^2)**

- We use `O(n^2)` extra space for storing the memoization table.
- The call stack depth is `O(n)`.

**Analysis**:

- This solution is much more efficient compared to the previous one because it avoids redundant computations by storing results in the memo table.

Sure! Let's break down Solution 2 step by step.

### Solution 2: Top-Down Memoization

In this solution, we use Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization to calculate the minimum path sum for the triangle. Memoization helps to store previously calculated values, avoiding redundant work.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the solution works:

1. **Input Setup and Initialization**:
   - The input is a triangle represented by a 2D vector, `triangle`.
   - We define a helper function `dfs(triangle, level, column, memo)` to recursively calculate the minimum path sum.
   - We initialize a 2D vector `memo` with dimensions matching the triangle, filled with the value `INT_MAX` to represent unvisited cells.

2. **Helper Function (DFS with Memoization)**:
   - The `dfs` function takes four arguments:
     - `triangle` - the triangle input.
     - `level` - the current row of the triangle.
     - `column` - the current column of the triangle.
     - `memo` - a 2D vector to store the previously computed minimum path sums.
  
3. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - **Base Case**: If `level` reaches the size of the triangle, we return `0` because we have reached beyond the last row.
   - If the current cell (`memo[level][column]`) has already been calculated, we return the stored value to avoid redundant calculations.
   - Otherwise, we calculate the two possible paths from the current cell:
     - Moving to the same index in the next row (`level + 1`, `column`).
     - Moving to the next index in the next row (`level + 1`, `column + 1`).
   - We then store the minimum of these two path sums in the `memo` table and add the value of the current cell (`triangle[level][column]`).
  
4. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, the `minimumTotal` function calls the `dfs` function starting from the top of the triangle (`dfs(triangle, 0, 0, memo)`) and returns the result.

### Step-by-Step Example

Let's take the triangle `[[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]` as an example.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 4` (number of rows).
   - `memo` is initialized as:
     ```
     [
       [INT_MAX, INT_MAX, INT_MAX, INT_MAX],
       [INT_MAX, INT_MAX, INT_MAX, INT_MAX],
       [INT_MAX, INT_MAX, INT_MAX, INT_MAX],
       [INT_MAX, INT_MAX, INT_MAX, INT_MAX]
     ]
     ```

2. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - Start from `(0, 0)` which contains the value `2`.
   - From `(0, 0)`:
     - Calculate both possible paths:
       - Down to `(1, 0)` which contains `3`.
       - Diagonally down to `(1, 1)` which contains `4`.
     - Recursively calculate the minimum path for both options.
     - This process continues until we reach the last row (`level == n`).

3. **Memoization**:
   - As the DFS proceeds, memoization helps to store the results of the sub-problems. For instance, if `(2, 0)` to `(3, 0)` and `(3, 1)` are already calculated, they are stored in `memo`.
   - The next time we need these results, we can use the values in `memo` instead of recalculating, which helps to optimize the solution.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Each node is visited at most once, and each recursive call does constant work, so the time complexity is `O(n^2)`.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is also `O(n^2)` due to the memoization table used to store the minimum path sums.

### Benefit of Memoization

The memoization technique significantly improves efficiency compared to a purely recursive solution, which would otherwise have exponential complexity due to redundant recalculations of overlapping sub-problems.

### Solution 3: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTotal(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& triangle) {
        int n = triangle.size();

        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(n + 1, 0));

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { // first deal with last row
            dp[n - 1][i] = triangle[n - 1][i];
        }

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) { // start from second last row and build up to (0, 0)
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 1][j + 1]) + triangle[i][j];
            }
        }

        return dp[0][0];
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity: O(n^2)**

- We traverse all elements of the triangle twice — first to initialize the last row and then to propagate the minimum sums upwards.

**Space Complexity: O(n^2)**

- The `dp` table has a size of `n * n`, which leads to `O(n^2)` space complexity.

**Analysis**:

- This bottom-up approach is efficient and calculates the minimum path sum iteratively, avoiding recursive function calls.

### Alternative Solution 4: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming with Reduced Space Complexity

We can optimize **Solution 3** further by reducing space complexity to `O(n)`:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTotal(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& triangle) {
        int n = triangle.size();
        std::vector<int> dp(n, 0);

        // Initialize dp with last row
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = triangle[n - 1][i];
        }

        // Compute from bottom-up, reducing space to O(n)
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                dp[j] = std::min(dp[j], dp[j + 1]) + triangle[i][j];
            }
        }

        return dp[0];
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity: O(n^2)**

- Similar to **Solution 3**, we traverse the entire triangle.

**Space Complexity: O(n)**

- This solution uses only one row of the triangle to store intermediate results, reducing space complexity to `O(n)`.

**Analysis**:

- This solution is optimal in both time and space.
- Instead of maintaining a 2D DP table, we reduce the size to `O(n)` by reusing the same array for storing intermediate results.

Sure! Let's fill up the DP table for Solution 3 step by step. For the triangle given:

```
   2
  3 4
 6 5 7
4 1 8 3
```

We initialize the DP table, where each element `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum path sum to reach the element at row `i` and column `j`.

### Step-by-Step Filling of DP Table

#### Initialize with Triangle Values
Initially, the DP table is a copy of the triangle values with an extra row at the bottom initialized to 0. Let me represent each step.

1. Copy the last row into the DP table:

```
   [0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0]
[4, 1, 8, 3] <- Last row copied from triangle
```

#### Fill DP Table Bottom-Up
2. Start filling from the second-last row upwards:

- **Row 2** (from bottom):

  For row 2 (`6, 5, 7`):

  - `dp[2][0] = min(dp[3][0], dp[3][1]) + triangle[2][0]`
    - `dp[2][0] = min(4, 1) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7`

  - `dp[2][1] = min(dp[3][1], dp[3][2]) + triangle[2][1]`
    - `dp[2][1] = min(1, 8) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6`

  - `dp[2][2] = min(dp[3][2], dp[3][3]) + triangle[2][2]`
    - `dp[2][2] = min(8, 3) + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10`

```
   [0, 0, 0, 0]
   [0, 0, 0, 0]
[7, 6, 10, 0]
[4, 1, 8, 3]
```

- **Row 1** (from bottom):

  For row 1 (`3, 4`):

  - `dp[1][0] = min(dp[2][0], dp[2][1]) + triangle[1][0]`
    - `dp[1][0] = min(7, 6) + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9`

  - `dp[1][1] = min(dp[2][1], dp[2][2]) + triangle[1][1]`
    - `dp[1][1] = min(6, 10) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10`

```
   [0, 0, 0, 0]
[9, 10, 0, 0]
[7, 6, 10, 0]
[4, 1, 8, 3]
```

- **Row 0** (top row):

  For row 0 (`2`):

  - `dp[0][0] = min(dp[1][0], dp[1][1]) + triangle[0][0]`
    - `dp[0][0] = min(9, 10) + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11`

```
[11, 0, 0, 0]
[9, 10, 0, 0]
[7, 6, 10, 0]
[4, 1, 8, 3]
```

### Final Result
The result is `dp[0][0]`, which is `11`.

Thus, the minimum path sum from top to bottom is `11`.

The algorithm in Solution 3 doesn't start from `index[0][0]` and go to the last index because it's using a **bottom-up dynamic programming approach**. This approach works by solving smaller subproblems first and building up to the final solution, which helps avoid repeated calculations and overlapping subproblems.

By starting from the last row and moving upwards, the algorithm calculates the minimum cost to reach each element from the base of the triangle to the top. This allows the minimum cost to be accumulated as we move to the root (`index[0][0]`).
