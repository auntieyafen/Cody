Here is a solution to find the minimum number of steps a knight needs to move to a given point `(x, y)` on an infinite chessboard:

To solve this problem, we will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. BFS is a good approach for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid-like graph.

### Solution:

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    int minKnightMoves(int x, int y) {
        // Use BFS to explore all possible moves
        x = abs(x);
        y = abs(y); // Reduce problem to first quadrant since it is symmetric

        // Define possible knight moves
        vector<pair<int, int>> moves = {
            {-2, -1}, {-1, -2}, {1, -2}, {2, -1},
            {2, 1}, {1, 2}, {-1, 2}, {-2, 1}
        };

        // Define a queue to store current position and steps taken
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({0, 0});
        int steps = 0;

        // Use a set to keep track of visited nodes
        unordered_set<string> visited;
        visited.insert("0,0");

        // Perform BFS
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                auto [current_x, current_y] = q.front();
                q.pop();

                // If we have reached the target
                if (current_x == x && current_y == y) {
                    return steps;
                }

                // Explore all possible knight moves
                for (auto move : moves) {
                    int new_x = current_x + move.first;
                    int new_y = current_y + move.second;

                    // Encode the new position to track if it has been visited
                    string pos = to_string(new_x) + "," + to_string(new_y);

                    if (visited.find(pos) == visited.end() && new_x >= -2 && new_y >= -2) {
                        q.push({new_x, new_y});
                        visited.insert(pos);
                    }
                }
            }
            steps++;
        }

        return -1; // Should never reach here since the answer is guaranteed to exist
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Symmetry**:
   - Since the knight's movement is symmetric across all four quadrants, we reduce the problem to the first quadrant (`x >= 0`, `y >= 0`) by taking the absolute value of the target coordinates.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - We use BFS to explore all possible positions the knight can reach in a minimal number of moves.
   - Starting from `(0, 0)`, we try all 8 possible moves and add them to the queue if they have not been visited before.
   - We continue this process until we reach the target `(x, y)`.

3. **Visited Set**:
   - We use an unordered set to track visited positions to avoid cycles and redundant calculations.
   - Each position is encoded as a string (`"x,y"`) to store in the set.

4. **Bounding Condition**:
   - For BFS, we only push new positions that are greater than or equal to `-2` for both x and y to prevent unnecessary exploration of positions far in the negative direction. The knight can move in any direction, so we keep an appropriate bound.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The BFS explores every possible position in increasing order of distance from `(0, 0)`. In the worst case, the number of nodes explored is proportional to `x * y`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is also proportional to `x * y` due to the space needed for the queue and the visited set. 

This solution guarantees finding the shortest path and is efficient for the given constraints.
