The idea is to use two pointers to iterate through both arrays. The first pointer (`i`) iterates over `nums1`, and the second pointer (`j`) starts from the same position and moves to find the furthest valid position in `nums2` for each value in `nums1`.

### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int maxDist = 0;

        while (i < nums1.size() && j < nums2.size()) {
            // If nums1[i] is smaller or equal to nums2[j], it is a valid pair
            if (nums1[i] <= nums2[j]) {
                maxDist = max(maxDist, j - i);
                ++j; // Move `j` to explore further to find a larger distance
            } else {
                ++i; // If not valid, move `i` to a smaller value in `nums1`
            }
        }

        return maxDist;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Start both pointers `i` and `j` at `0`, and initialize `maxDist` to `0`.
2. **Loop through both arrays**:
   - Move the second pointer `j` to find the largest valid distance for each value in `nums1`.
   - If `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]`, update `maxDist` as `max(maxDist, j - i)` and increment `j` to see if a larger distance is possible.
   - If `nums1[i] > nums2[j]`, move `i` to the next position to see if the next element in `nums1` fits in `nums2`.
3. **Return**: The `maxDist` value holds the maximum distance found.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. Since both `i` and `j` are traversing their respective arrays at most once, the complexity is linear.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we only use a constant amount of extra space. 

The two-pointer approach is efficient in finding the maximum valid distance, as it avoids redundant comparisons and makes sure both arrays are traversed in a linear pass.
