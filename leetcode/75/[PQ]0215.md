### Suggested Improvements:
1. **Use a Min-Heap of Size `k`**:
   - Instead of constructing a max-heap of the entire array, which takes `O(n log n)` time and uses additional memory, you can use a **min-heap of size `k`**.
   - The min-heap will store the top `k` largest elements, and the root will always be the `k`th largest element. This gives a time complexity of **`O(n log k)`**, which is more efficient.

Here is how you can implement it:

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int findKthLargest(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Use a min-heap of size k
        std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> minHeap;

        for (int num : nums) {
            minHeap.push(num);
            // Maintain the heap size to be k
            if (minHeap.size() > k) {
                minHeap.pop();
            }
        }

        // The top element is the kth largest element
        return minHeap.top();
    }
};
```

### Why This is Better:
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Building a max-heap of all elements (`O(n)` operation) and extracting the top `k` elements (`O(k log n)`) results in a time complexity of approximately **`O(n + k log n)`**.
   - With a min-heap of size `k`, the time complexity is reduced to **`O(n log k)`**, which is significantly faster for large inputs where `k` is much smaller than `n`.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Your original approach uses a max-heap that stores all the elements, which requires **`O(n)`** additional space.
   - The min-heap approach maintains a heap of size **`k`**, requiring **`O(k)`** space, which is much more efficient when `k` is small compared to `n`.

### Summary:
- The min-heap approach is more efficient in both time complexity and space complexity.
- Maintaining a heap of size `k` ensures that you only keep track of the `k` largest elements, making operations on the heap faster.
