To solve the problem of determining if the string `s` can be transformed into the string `goal` by shifting characters, you can implement the following solution:

### C++ Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool rotateString(string s, string goal) {
        if (s.length() != goal.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        string doubled = s + s;  // Concatenate s with itself
        return doubled.find(goal) != string::npos;  // Check if goal is a substring of doubled
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Concatenate `s` with itself**:
   - When you concatenate `s` with itself (`doubled = s + s`), it contains all possible rotations of `s`.
   - For example, if `s = "abcde"`, then `doubled = "abcdeabcde"`.

2. **Check if `goal` is a substring**:
   - You just need to check if `goal` is a substring of `doubled`.
   - If `goal` is present in `doubled`, it means `s` can be rotated to match `goal`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `s`. The concatenation and substring search are both linear.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, due to storing `doubled`. 

### Example:
1. **Input**: `s = "abcde"`, `goal = "cdeab"`
   - `doubled = "abcdeabcde"`, and `goal` is a substring of `doubled`.
   - **Output**: `true`.

2. **Input**: `s = "abcde"`, `goal = "abced"`
   - `doubled = "abcdeabcde"`, and `goal` is **not** a substring of `doubled`.
   - **Output**: `false`.

`std::string::npos` is a constant value that represents the "not found" state for string operations. It is used as a return value by functions like `find()` when the substring or character you are searching for is not present in the string.

For example:

```cpp
std::string s = "hello";
if (s.find("world") == std::string::npos) {
    std::cout << "Substring not found" << std::endl;
}
```

In this code, `s.find("world")` returns `std::string::npos` because the substring "world" does not exist in `s`.
