1. **Min-Heap Maintenance**: When pushing elements into the min-heap, you should maintain a size of `k` to avoid storing unnecessary elements. Keep popping the smallest element if the heap size exceeds `k`.

2. **Extract Elements from the Heap**: After collecting the top `k` elements in the min-heap, extract them in the correct order, as the min-heap will give you the smallest element first.

Here's the fixed and improved code:

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> topKFrequent(vector<string>& words, int k) {
        unordered_map<string, int> wordCounts;
        vector<string> res;

        // Count the frequency of each word
        for (const string& word : words)
            wordCounts[word]++;

        // Min-heap: use a priority queue with a custom comparator
        auto cmp = [](const pair<string, int>& a, const pair<string, int>& b) {
            // 1. Sort primarily by frequency (ascending)
            if (a.second != b.second) {
                return a.second > b.second;
            }
            // 2. Sort secondarily by lexicographical order (descending)
            return a.first < b.first;
        };
        priority_queue<pair<string, int>, vector<pair<string, int>>, decltype(cmp)> wordsPQ(cmp);

        // Push elements into the min-heap
        for (const auto& wordCount : wordCounts) {
            wordsPQ.push(wordCount);
            if (wordsPQ.size() > k) {
                wordsPQ.pop(); // Maintain only the top k elements
            }
        }

        // Extract the k most frequent elements from the heap
        while (!wordsPQ.empty()) {
            res.emplace_back(wordsPQ.top().first);
            wordsPQ.pop();
        }

        // Since we need the result in descending order of frequency, reverse the result
        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());

        return res;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Custom Comparator for Min-Heap**: 
   - The comparator sorts primarily by frequency in ascending order and secondarily by lexicographical order in descending order. This ensures that the element with the lowest frequency or lexicographical order is at the top of the heap.

2. **Maintaining Only Top k Elements**:
   - When pushing into the heap, check if the size exceeds `k`. If it does, pop the top element to maintain only `k` elements in the heap.

3. **Reverse the Result**:
   - Since the min-heap provides the least frequent element first, you need to reverse the result to provide the most frequent elements in descending order.

### Time Complexity:
- **Heap Operations**: Each insertion and removal in the heap takes `O(log k)`. Since we iterate over `n` words and maintain a heap of size `k`, the overall complexity for heap operations is `O(n log k)`.
- **Word Count Calculation**: Calculating the frequency of words takes `O(n)`.
- **Total Complexity**: `O(n log k)`.

### Space Complexity:
- **Heap**: The heap stores at most `k` elements, so it uses `O(k)` space.
- **HashMap**: The hash map stores the frequency of all `n` words, resulting in `O(n)` space usage.
- **Total Space**: `O(n + k)`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Counting Frequencies**: We iterate over `words`, counting the occurrences in `O(n)` time.
- **Heap Operations**: We use a **min-heap** of size `k`, and for each word (`n` words), we perform heap operations (insert/push and potentially pop) which take **O(log k)** time. Thus, the overall heap operation complexity is **O(n log k)**.
- **Reverse Step**: The reverse operation takes **O(k)** time, which is negligible compared to the heap operations.

### Space Complexity:
- **HashMap for Frequencies**: We use a hash map to store frequencies, which uses **O(n)** space.
- **Min-Heap for Top k**: We use a min-heap of size `k`, which uses **O(k)** space.
- **Total Space**: The space complexity is **O(n + k)**, which is effectively **O(n)** as `k` is usually much smaller than `n`.

This approach satisfies the required complexity of **O(n log k)** time and **O(n)** extra space. Let me know if you need further clarification or improvements!
