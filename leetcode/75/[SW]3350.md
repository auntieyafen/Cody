### Code Explanation

The given code aims to find the maximum possible value of `k` for which there exist two adjacent strictly increasing subarrays of length `k` each. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `ans` holds the result, the maximum possible value of `k`.
   - `increasing` keeps track of the length of the current strictly increasing subarray.
   - `prevIncreasing` keeps track of the length of the previous strictly increasing subarray.

2. **Iterate Through `nums`**:
   - Loop starts at `i = 1` to compare the current element with the previous one.
   - If `nums[i] > nums[i - 1]`, increment the current length (`increasing`).
   - If the condition is not met, set `prevIncreasing` to `increasing` (record the current increasing sequence length) and reset `increasing` to 1 to start a new sequence.

3. **Update Maximum `k`**:
   - To find the maximum `k` for adjacent strictly increasing subarrays:
     - The possible value of `k` is either `increasing / 2` (split the current sequence into two halves) or `min(prevIncreasing, increasing)` (if `prevIncreasing` and `increasing` can form adjacent increasing subarrays of the same length).
   - Update `ans` to store the maximum possible value.

4. **Return Result**:
   - The result (`ans`) is returned.

### Time Complexity (TC)
- **O(n)**: The solution involves a single pass through the input array `nums`, where `n` is the size of the array. The operations inside the loop (increment, assignment, `max`, and `min`) are all constant time (`O(1)`).

### Space Complexity (SC)
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant since the solution only uses a fixed number of variables (`ans`, `increasing`, and `prevIncreasing`) and no additional data structures that grow with input size.

### Summary
The solution efficiently finds the maximum possible length of two adjacent strictly increasing subarrays by iterating through the input array, keeping track of the lengths of the current and previous strictly increasing sequences. It has optimal time complexity (`O(n)`) and constant space complexity (`O(1)`), which makes it both efficient and scalable.
