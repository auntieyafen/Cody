Here's another solution that uses a dynamic programming approach, but explicitly stores intermediate costs in an array rather than only maintaining the last house costs. This approach can be useful if you'd like to trace the computation values of each house.

### Modified Solution with Explicit Dynamic Programming Array:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        if (costs.empty()) return 0;

        int n = costs.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(3, 0));
        
        // Initialize the cost of painting the first house
        dp[0][0] = costs[0][0];
        dp[0][1] = costs[0][1];
        dp[0][2] = costs[0][2];
        
        // Iterate over each house and calculate the minimum cost for each color
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i][0] = costs[i][0] + min(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2]);
            dp[i][1] = costs[i][1] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2]);
            dp[i][2] = costs[i][2] + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]);
        }
        
        // The result will be the minimum cost of painting the last house with any color
        return min(dp[n-1][0], min(dp[n-1][1], dp[n-1][2]));
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: The `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to paint up to house `i` with color `j`.
- **Initialization**: The first row (`dp[0][0], dp[0][1], dp[0][2]`) is initialized with the respective costs of the first house.
- **Recurrence**: For each house, the cost to paint it a specific color is determined by adding the current cost to the minimum cost from the previous house, excluding the same color.
- **Result**: After filling the `dp` array, the answer will be the minimum value of painting the last house.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of houses. Each house is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to storing costs for each house. This can be improved to O(1) if you only keep track of costs for the current and previous houses, similar to the original solution.

This solution is more illustrative and is useful for understanding the state of each house in the dynamic programming process.

### Original Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        int lastRed = 0, lastGreen = 0, lastBlue = 0;

        for (auto& cost : costs) {
            int prevRed = lastRed, prevGreen = lastGreen, prevBlue = lastBlue;
          
            lastRed = min(prevGreen, prevBlue) + cost[0];
            lastGreen = min(prevRed, prevBlue) + cost[1];
            lastBlue = min(prevRed, prevGreen) + cost[2];
        }

        return min(lastRed, min(lastGreen, lastBlue));
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialize Last Costs**:
   - The variables `lastRed`, `lastGreen`, and `lastBlue` are initialized to 0 to represent the initial cost of painting the last house with either red, green, or blue.
   
2. **Loop Through Houses**:
   - For each house in the `costs` vector, the `for` loop iterates and updates the cost to paint that house.
   - `prevRed`, `prevGreen`, and `prevBlue` store the previous costs for the respective colors before updating them.
   
3. **Update Costs**:
   - To calculate the cost of painting the current house red (`lastRed`), the cost is added to the minimum of the costs of painting the previous house either green or blue (`min(prevGreen, prevBlue) + cost[0]`).
   - Similarly, the costs for painting the house green (`lastGreen`) and blue (`lastBlue`) are calculated in the same way by excluding the color that was painted on the previous house.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After calculating the costs for all houses, the result will be the minimum of `lastRed`, `lastGreen`, and `lastBlue`, which represents the least cost of painting all the houses while adhering to the rule that no two adjacent houses can have the same color.

### Key Points:
- **Dynamic Programming**: This approach uses dynamic programming to update costs iteratively without keeping track of every house. Instead, it uses only the last house's costs, which saves memory.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a few extra variables, regardless of the number of houses.
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n) where `n` is the number of houses. This is because the code iterates through all houses exactly once.

The original code is efficient in both time and space since it reduces the storage requirements by keeping track of only the previous house's costs.
