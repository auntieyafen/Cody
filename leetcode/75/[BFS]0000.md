To solve this problem, you need to consider the fuel constraint and find the shortest path while ensuring you don't run out of fuel. This can be approached using a modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm that tracks not only the distance but also the current fuel state. Here's a C++ solution for the problem:

To solve the problem efficiently, we can use a modified BFS. This approach helps us explore all potential paths, maintaining the shortest possible route while also managing the fuel level in each city.

This implementation uses a modified BFS that ensures the fuel capacity is considered while traversing the graph.

### Explanation:

- **State Structure:** Each state keeps track of the `city`, `fuel` level, and `distance` traveled.
- **Graph Representation:** The graph is constructed using an adjacency list.
- **Queue for BFS:** A queue is used to manage the BFS traversal. Each element in the queue contains the current city, the remaining fuel, and the current distance.
- **Visited Map:** The `visited` map keeps track of which nodes have been visited with a certain fuel level to avoid revisiting.
- **Fuel Management:** Whenever the car reaches a fuel station, the fuel is refilled to its capacity.
- **Neighbor Traversal:** The BFS checks all neighboring cities, and if there is enough fuel, it moves to the next city.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices (cities) and `E` is the number of edges (roads).
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(V * C)` where `C` is the fuel capacity, due to the need to track visited states for each possible fuel level.

The BFS approach ensures that we find the shortest path while managing the fuel constraints.
