This problem is similar to the "House Robber" problem, but with the additional complication that the houses are arranged in a circle. This means that the first and last houses are adjacent, and we cannot rob both. The optimal solution is to treat the problem as two separate linear House Robber problems:

1. Rob from house 0 to n-2.
2. Rob from house 1 to n-1.

Here's the solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 1) return nums[0];
        if (n == 2) return max(nums[0], nums[1]);

        // Calculate the maximum amount without including either the first or last house
        return max(robLinear(nums, 0, n - 2), robLinear(nums, 1, n - 1));
    }

private:
    // Helper function to calculate the maximum rob amount for a linear array of houses
    int robLinear(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        int prev2 = 0, prev1 = 0;
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            int current = max(prev1, prev2 + nums[i]);
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }
        return prev1;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there's only one house, simply return its value.
   - If there are two houses, return the maximum value between the two.

2. **Divide the Problem**:
   - Use the helper function `robLinear()` to calculate the maximum amount you can rob if:
     - You **include house 0** and **exclude the last house** (`nums[0]` to `nums[n-2]`).
     - You **exclude house 0** and **include the last house** (`nums[1]` to `nums[n-1]`).

3. **Helper Function (`robLinear()`)**:
   - Implements the linear version of the House Robber problem using dynamic programming.
   - Keep track of the maximum amounts up to two houses ago (`prev2`) and up to the previous house (`prev1`).
   - Calculate the maximum amount for the current house and update `prev2` and `prev1`.

4. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` since we iterate through the houses twice.
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` since we only use a constant amount of extra space. 

This solution efficiently determines the maximum amount you can rob from a circle of houses without alerting the police.
