The code is using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Here's why:

1. **Queue-Based Approach**: You use a queue (`queue<pair<int, int>> rottenOrangeSpots`) to keep track of the cells that contain rotten oranges. This queue allows you to traverse the nodes level by level, which is characteristic of BFS.
  
2. **Processing in Levels**: Each iteration of the `while (!rottenOrangeSpots.empty())` loop processes all nodes at the current level (i.e., all rotten oranges at a given time). The use of `int n = rottenOrangeSpots.size();` helps in processing the oranges level by level, which is a key characteristic of BFS.

3. **Exploring Neighboring Nodes**: You explore each of the four possible neighbors (up, down, left, right) for each rotten orange. Adding the newly rotten oranges to the queue (`rottenOrangeSpots.push(...)`) ensures that they will be processed in the subsequent level, which mimics the BFS approach.

The goal of BFS here is to propagate the rotting effect from each rotten orange to its adjacent fresh oranges, level by level, until no fresh oranges remain or no more propagation is possible. This allows you to calculate the time taken for all the oranges to rot, which is the required solution.
