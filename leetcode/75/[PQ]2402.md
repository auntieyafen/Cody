To solve this problem efficiently, you need to track the usage of each room and decide which meeting to allocate to which room, based on availability and meeting start times.

I'll show you how to proceed using a min-heap (priority queue) for tracking room availability and meeting end times:

1. Use a min-heap to keep track of room availability. Store rooms as they become free, and always allocate the room with the smallest number.
2. Use another min-heap to keep track of ongoing meetings. Keep track of when a room becomes available.
3. Track which room has the most meetings.

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting Meetings**: Sort the meetings by their start time to ensure they are processed in the correct order.
2. **Min-Heap for Available Rooms**: `availableRooms` is used to always get the room with the smallest number when multiple rooms are available.
3. **Min-Heap for Ongoing Meetings**: `ongoingMeetings` keeps track of meetings that are currently happening, with their end times. This helps determine when a room will become available.
4. **Assigning Rooms**:
   - If there's an available room, assign it to the current meeting.
   - If no room is available, delay the meeting to start after the earliest ongoing meeting ends, keeping the duration of the meeting the same.
5. **Tracking Room Usage**: Keep track of how many meetings each room holds, then find the room with the maximum count.

This approach ensures that:
- Meetings are allocated based on room availability.
- Delayed meetings start as soon as a room is free.
- The solution is efficient, using heaps to manage room allocation and end times.
Sure, I can illustrate the algorithm used in the code for finding the room that holds the most meetings by breaking down its logic step by step with a conceptual diagram.

Here’s how the algorithm proceeds:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Sort the meetings based on their start times.
   - Use a **priority queue (min-heap)** for room allocation.
   - Track ongoing meetings and the number of meetings each room has completed.

2. **Using Priority Queues**:
   - Use two priority queues:
     - `availableRooms`: Manages rooms that are free, sorted by room number.
     - `ongoingMeetings`: Keeps track of meetings currently taking place, sorted by end times.
   - Each time a room is freed, it's added back to the available list for reuse.

3. **Illustration**:
   Imagine the meetings are represented by boxes and rooms are depicted as available slots. Let’s say we have rooms 0, 1, and 2 and meetings:

   ```
   Meeting 1: Start = 1, End = 5
   Meeting 2: Start = 2, End = 6
   Meeting 3: Start = 3, End = 9
   ```

   - **At time 1**: Meeting 1 starts, assigned to room 0.
     - Available Rooms: `[1, 2]`
     - Ongoing: `[(5, 0)]`
   - **At time 2**: Meeting 2 starts, assigned to room 1.
     - Available Rooms: `[2]`
     - Ongoing: `[(5, 0), (6, 1)]`
   - **At time 3**: Meeting 3 starts, assigned to room 2.
     - Available Rooms: `[]`
     - Ongoing: `[(5, 0), (6, 1), (9, 2)]`

   Once a room is available again (i.e., the end time of a meeting passes), it is pushed back into `availableRooms`. The algorithm always attempts to assign meetings based on room availability and minimizes waiting.

The **graphical representation** can be imagined as a timeline, with each room assigned blocks representing meetings. Each time a meeting ends, the slot (i.e., room) opens up, and the next meeting is assigned to the available slot.

This **min-heap approach** ensures that you always allocate the available room with the smallest index first, optimizing the allocation based on meeting timings and keeping track of room usage effectively.
