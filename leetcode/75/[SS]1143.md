Sure, let's go through the table that is used in the dynamic programming approach for finding the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two strings, `text1` and `text2`. The table (`dp`) is a 2D matrix where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LCS of the two substrings `text1[0..i-1]` and `text2[0..j-1]`. 

Here is how the table is filled out:

### Example:

Consider `text1 = "abcde"` and `text2 = "ace"`.

**Step 1: Initialize the Table**
- The `dp` table has dimensions `(m + 1) x (n + 1)` where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `text1` and `text2`. 
- The extra row and column (at index 0) help represent cases where either string is empty, and thus LCS length is 0.

Initially, the table looks like:

```
    0  a  c  e
  0 0  0  0  0
a 0 0
b 0
c 0
d 0
e 0
```

### Step 2: Fill the DP Table
- We iterate through `text1` and `text2` to fill the table using the rules:
  - If `text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`.
  - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

Here's how it progresses:

1. When comparing `a` (in `text1`) with `a` (in `text2`), we get a match.
    ```
        0  a  c  e
      0 0  0  0  0
    a 0 1
    b 0
    c 0
    d 0
    e 0
    ```
   - Since there's a match, we take `1 + dp[i-1][j-1] = 1`.
  
2. Continue to fill based on the comparison results:
    ```
        0  a  c  e
      0 0  0  0  0
    a 0 1  1  1
    b 0 1  1  1
    c 0 1  2  2
    d 0 1  2  2
    e 0 1  2  3
    ```
  
   - `c` in both strings results in `dp[3][2] = 2`.
   - `e` matches at `dp[5][3]`, and gives us `dp[5][3] = 3`.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the LCS is `dp[m][n] = dp[5][3] = 3`.

### Summary
The table shows the progression of matching characters and determining the LCS length for each combination of the prefixes of `text1` and `text2`. 

The value at the bottom-right (`dp[m][n]`) gives the length of the LCS.
