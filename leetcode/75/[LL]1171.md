To solve this problem, you can use a prefix sum approach to remove all consecutive nodes whose sum is zero. Here's a solution for the given problem:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode* head) {
        // Dummy node to handle edge cases easily
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;

        // Hash map to store prefix sum and corresponding node
        unordered_map<int, ListNode*> prefixSumMap;
        prefixSumMap[0] = dummy;

        int prefixSum = 0;
        ListNode* current = dummy;

        // First pass: calculate prefix sum and add nodes to hash map
        while (current != nullptr) {
            prefixSum += current->val;
            prefixSumMap[prefixSum] = current;
            current = current->next;
        }

        prefixSum = 0;
        current = dummy;

        // Second pass: use the prefix sum map to remove zero sum sublists
        while (current != nullptr) {
            prefixSum += current->val;
            current->next = prefixSumMap[prefixSum]->next;
            current = current->next;
        }

        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Prefix Sum Approach**: This solution leverages the prefix sum concept, where the prefix sum up to a certain node is stored in a hash map.
2. **First Pass**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum and store each sum in a hash map (`prefixSumMap`), where the key is the sum and the value is the corresponding node.
   - If the same prefix sum is seen twice, it means that the nodes between these occurrences sum to zero.
3. **Second Pass**:
   - Traverse the linked list again and adjust pointers to remove the zero-sum sublists.
4. **Dummy Node**: A dummy node is used to handle edge cases, such as the removal of the head node or multiple nodes.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), due to the hash map used to store prefix sums.

This approach effectively removes all consecutive sublists that sum to zero in O(N) time while keeping the space complexity manageable.
