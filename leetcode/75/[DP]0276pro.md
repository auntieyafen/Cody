This problem is very similar to the previous fence painting problem but involves painting **houses** where two consecutive houses cannot have the same color. We can solve it efficiently using dynamic programming.

### Code

Here is an **optimized dynamic programming solution** for this problem:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaysToPaintHouses(int n, int k) {
        // Base case: No houses to paint
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // Base case: If there's only one house, it can be painted in k ways
        if (n == 1) return k;

        // If there's more than one house, initialize the number of ways
        int sameColor = 0;           // No way to paint with the same color initially
        int differentColor = k;      // First house can be painted in k different colors

        // Iteratively compute the number of ways for each house
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int temp = differentColor;

            // The current house cannot have the same color as the previous one, 
            // thus ways to paint it in a different color is `(k - 1) * (differentColor + sameColor)`
            differentColor = (differentColor + sameColor) * (k - 1);

            // The number of ways to paint it the same color is simply the previous value of `differentColor`
            sameColor = temp;
        }

        // The result is the sum of the two possibilities for the last house
        return differentColor + sameColor;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**:
   - If `n == 0`, there are no houses to paint, so the result is `0`.
   - If `n == 1`, there are `k` colors to choose from, so the result is `k`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `sameColor` represents the number of ways to paint the current house the same color as the previous house.
   - `differentColor` represents the number of ways to paint the current house a different color from the previous one.

3. **Iterate**:
   - Iterate through all the houses starting from index `1` to `n - 1`:
     - Store the current value of `differentColor` in `temp`.
     - Update `differentColor` by calculating the number of ways to paint with a different color, which is `(sameColor + differentColor) * (k - 1)`.
     - Update `sameColor` to be equal to `temp`.

4. **Return**:
   - Return `differentColor + sameColor`, which represents the number of ways to paint all houses.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of houses. We iterate over each house once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we only use a constant amount of space to keep track of `sameColor` and `differentColor`.

This solution reduces the problem to using **constant space**, while maintaining `O(n)` time complexity, making it both time and space efficient.

If we have specific colors for the first and last house, we need to add constraints to the solution. Let's denote:

- `firstColor` is the color for the first house.
- `lastColor` is the color for the last house.

We need to adapt our algorithm to consider these constraints while ensuring no adjacent houses have the same color and that the first and last houses have fixed colors.

Here is a dynamic programming solution to solve this problem:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaysToPaintHouses(int n, int k, int firstColor, int lastColor) {
        // Base case: If no houses to paint
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // If there's only one house
        if (n == 1) return firstColor == lastColor ? 1 : 0;

        // Initialize the cost of painting the first house with a specific color
        vector<int> current(k + 1, 0), previous(k + 1, 0);
        current[firstColor] = 1;

        // Iterate over each house
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            previous = current;
            fill(current.begin(), current.end(), 0);

            for (int color = 1; color <= k; ++color) {
                for (int prevColor = 1; prevColor <= k; ++prevColor) {
                    if (color != prevColor) {
                        current[color] += previous[prevColor];
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Result: Number of ways to paint with first and last house colors specified
        return current[lastColor];
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We use two vectors `current` and `previous` to keep track of ways to paint the houses.
   - Set `current[firstColor] = 1` since the first house must be painted with `firstColor`.

2. **Iterate Over Houses**:
   - For each house starting from `1` to `n-1`, update the ways to paint the current house.
   - We loop over all possible colors for the current house and all possible colors for the previous house.
   - If the color is different from the previous color, we add the ways to paint the previous house with the previous color to `current[color]`.

3. **Result**:
   - At the end, we return `current[lastColor]` which represents the number of ways to paint all houses while ensuring the first and last houses have the specific colors.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * k^2)`, where `n` is the number of houses and `k` is the number of colors. We iterate over each house and check all pairs of current and previous colors.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`, since we use two vectors of size `k + 1`.

This approach ensures that we satisfy the constraints of the first and last houses having specific colors while ensuring no adjacent houses have the same color.
