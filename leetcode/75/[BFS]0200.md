### Explanation:
1. **BFS Traversal**:
   - This solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse each island, starting from any unvisited land cell ('1').
   - The BFS is implemented using a queue of pairs `(r, c)` that represent the coordinates of each cell in the grid.
   - We mark cells as visited by changing their value from `'1'` to `'0'`.

2. **Directional Movement**:
   - The BFS checks the four possible directions: up, right, down, and left, using the direction vectors `delta_row` and `delta_col`.

3. **Counting Islands**:
   - Every time we find an unvisited land cell ('1'), we initiate a BFS and increment the count of islands.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: We potentially visit every cell in the grid once. Each cell is added to the queue at most once during traversal.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(min(m, n))**: The maximum number of elements in the queue at any point is the size of the smaller dimension (width or height), which occurs if the grid is completely filled with land in a worst-case scenario. Additionally, the space complexity includes **O(1)** auxiliary space for direction vectors and other small variables.

### Solution Using DFS:

### Explanation:
1. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Whenever an unvisited land cell (`'1'`) is found, a DFS is initiated.
   - During DFS, the function recursively moves in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
   - The cells are marked as visited by changing their value from `'1'` to `'0'`.

2. **Marking Cells**:
   - Marking a cell as `'0'` means it is already part of an island and has been visited, preventing repeated counting.

3. **Counting Islands**:
   - Each time a DFS is started, it means we have found a new island. The count is incremented accordingly.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: We potentially visit every cell in the grid once. Each cell is either part of an island or water and gets visited once during traversal.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n)** in the worst case (if the entire grid is filled with land), the maximum depth of recursion is the size of the grid. It is the space taken by the call stack.
