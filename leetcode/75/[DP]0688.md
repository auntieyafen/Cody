Below is a solution for calculating the probability that a knight stays on an n x n chessboard after making exactly k moves using a dynamic programming approach:

### Explanation:

1. **Possible Moves**: The knight can make 8 different moves from its current position, represented by `(r + dr, c + dc)` pairs.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - `dp[step][r][c]` represents the probability that the knight is at position `(r, c)` after `step` moves.
   - Start with `dp[0][row][column] = 1.0` because the knight starts from `(row, column)` with probability 1.

3. **State Transition**:
   - For each step from `1` to `k`, iterate over the entire board.
   - For every position `(r, c)`, check if the knight can move there. If yes, update the probability to the new position by adding the current cell's probability divided by `8` to its new position in the next step.

4. **Total Probability**:
   - After making all the `k` moves, sum up all the probabilities on the chessboard to get the answer.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(k * n^2)**: The algorithm iterates through every cell for `k` moves, with each move having a constant number of iterations (8 possible directions).
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - **O(k * n^2)**: We are storing probabilities for each of the `k` steps in a 3D array.

This dynamic programming solution is more efficient than recursive backtracking with memoization and uses a bottom-up approach to find the solution.
