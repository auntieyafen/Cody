### Explanation
1. **Helper Function (`countMissingUpToIndex`)**:
   - This function returns the number of missing elements from the start up to index `i`.
2. **Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to find the first index `left` where the missing count is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - By doing so, you can efficiently locate the interval where the k-th missing number lies.
3. **Calculation**:
   - Once the correct interval is located, calculate the exact missing number.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` for binary search and `O(1)` for the calculation, resulting in an overall complexity of `O(log n)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` because no extra data structures are used apart from basic variables. 

This binary search approach is more efficient than the linear solution, especially for large input sizes, because it finds the k-th missing element in logarithmic time.

Instead of using a lambda and binary search, you could use a simpler linear approach if the size of the array is relatively small. Hereâ€™s how:

### Approach
Traverse through the sorted array, count the missing elements, and stop when you reach the k-th missing element.

### Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int missingElement(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int missingCount = 0;
        
        // Traverse the array to find the k-th missing element
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int gap = nums[i] - nums[i - 1] - 1; // Calculate missing elements between nums[i-1] and nums[i]
            if (missingCount + gap >= k) {
                // If k-th missing is in this gap, calculate its value
                return nums[i - 1] + k - missingCount;
            }
            missingCount += gap;
        }
        
        // If k-th missing element is after the last element in the array
        return nums[n - 1] + k - missingCount;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- **Traverse the array** to find the number of missing elements (`gap`) between each pair of consecutive elements.
- **Update the count of missing elements (`missingCount`)** until it is greater or equal to `k`.
- If the **k-th missing element** lies within the gap between `nums[i-1]` and `nums[i]`, compute its value.
- If not, the **k-th missing element is after the last element** in the array.

This approach runs in **O(n)** time complexity, which can be more efficient for relatively small input sizes compared to the binary search version for large `k`. However, if `n` is very large, the binary search approach would be more efficient.

If you want to use binary search, you can follow the approach that I provided previously, which uses a custom lambda function to count the number of missing elements up to a given index. Below is a simplified explanation of how to solve the problem using binary search:

### Approach
1. **Define a Helper Function**: Define a helper function that calculates how many elements are missing up to a given index.
2. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to locate the position where the cumulative number of missing elements reaches or exceeds `k`.
