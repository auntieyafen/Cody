To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming. We'll keep track of the minimum cost to reach each cell in the grid row by row. Here's how you can implement it:

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:  
   - We start by initializing a `dp` vector that stores the minimum cost to reach each cell in the first row. Initially, it's just the value of the first row (`grid[0]`).

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:  
   - We iterate over each row, starting from the second row.
   - For each cell in the current row, calculate the minimum cost to reach it from any cell in the previous row.
   - Use the `moveCost` array to add the respective cost of moving between rows.
   - Store these values in a `newDp` vector and update `dp` for the next iteration.

3. **Result Extraction**:  
   - Finally, we return the minimum value from the last row.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because, for each cell in each row, we look at every cell in the previous row.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) since we use two vectors of size `n` to store the current and previous row costs. 

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum path cost using dynamic programming to store and update the minimum costs row by row.
