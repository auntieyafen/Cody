Yes, you can solve this problem by checking if the new interval overlaps with any of the already booked intervals. You can use a data structure, such as a list, to store existing events and iterate through them to see if the new event overlaps with any of the previously booked events.

Here's an implementation:

```cpp
class MyCalendar {
public:
    // Initialize the calendar as an empty vector of pairs
    vector<pair<int, int>> bookings;

    MyCalendar() {}
    
    bool book(int start, int end) {
        // Iterate through all the existing bookings
        for (const auto& booking : bookings) {
            // Check if the new booking overlaps with any existing booking
            if (max(start, booking.first) < min(end, booking.second)) {
                return false; // Overlapping interval found, return false
            }
        }
        // If no overlaps, add the new booking to the calendar and return true
        bookings.emplace_back(start, end);
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Structure**: A vector of pairs (`vector<pair<int, int>>`) is used to store existing events.
2. **Check Overlaps**: When adding a new event, iterate through the vector to check if the new event overlaps with any existing ones:
   - If the maximum of the start times (`max(start, booking.first)`) is less than the minimum of the end times (`min(end, booking.second)`), there is an overlap.
3. **Insert if No Overlaps**: If no overlaps are found, insert the new booking.

This solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` per booking since you iterate through all existing bookings. It can be improved using balanced data structures like `std::map` (e.g., a binary search tree), which allows for efficient insertion and searching in `O(log n)` time. 

Here's an optimized solution using `std::map`:

```cpp
class MyCalendar {
public:
    map<int, int> bookings;

    MyCalendar() {}
    
    bool book(int start, int end) {
        auto next = bookings.lower_bound(start);
        if (next != bookings.end() && next->first < end) {
            return false; // Overlaps with the next event
        }
        if (next != bookings.begin() && prev(next)->second > start) {
            return false; // Overlaps with the previous event
        }
        bookings[start] = end;
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Optimized Approach:
- **Data Structure**: The `std::map` data structure stores events sorted by their start times.
- **Finding Overlaps**: 
  - Use `lower_bound(start)` to find the first event that starts at or after `start`.
  - Check if this event starts before `end` (which would imply an overlap).
  - Also, check the previous event to ensure its end time does not extend beyond the start of the new event.

This solution reduces the complexity of adding an event from `O(n)` to `O(log n)`, which makes it more efficient for large inputs.

### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

#### 1. **First Solution using Vector of Pairs (`vector<pair<int, int>>`)**
##### Time Complexity:
- **Book Operation**: The `book` function iterates through all the existing events to check for overlaps.
  - **Worst Case Complexity**: `O(n)` for each booking operation, where `n` is the number of already booked intervals.
  - As we need to check all the existing events for potential overlaps, the complexity is linear in relation to the number of bookings.

##### Space Complexity:
- **Booking Data Structure**: The events are stored in a `vector` of pairs.
  - The storage requires `O(n)` space where `n` is the number of bookings.

##### Summary:
- **Time Complexity** (for booking): `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`

#### 2. **Optimized Solution using `std::map`**
##### Time Complexity:
- **Book Operation**: The `book` function uses the `std::map` to store the events.
  - Using `lower_bound()` to check for overlaps has a complexity of `O(log n)` as `std::map` is implemented as a balanced binary search tree.
  - Inserting a new event is also `O(log n)`.
  - **Worst Case Complexity**: `O(log n)` for each booking operation.

##### Space Complexity:
- **Booking Data Structure**: The events are stored in a `std::map`, which has space complexity of `O(n)` since all the events are stored.
  - The map stores keys (start times) and values (end times), requiring linear space with respect to the number of events.

##### Summary:
- **Time Complexity** (for booking): `O(log n)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`

### Conclusion:
- The first solution using a vector of pairs has **linear time complexity (`O(n)`)** for each booking operation, which is less efficient compared to the optimized approach.
- The optimized solution using `std::map` reduces the time complexity for each booking to **`O(log n)`**, making it more suitable for larger inputs.
- Both solutions have a space complexity of **`O(n)`** since they both store all booked intervals. 

The second solution is better suited for scenarios with a large number of bookings due to its logarithmic time complexity for adding and checking intervals.
