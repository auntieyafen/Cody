To solve the problem of calculating the number of car fleets, we need to determine the times at which each car arrives at the destination and group cars into fleets based on their relative speeds. Here's a solution in C++:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int carFleet(int target, vector<int>& position, vector<int>& speed) {
        int n = position.size();
        vector<pair<int, double>> cars; // Stores (position, time to reach target)

        // Calculate the time for each car to reach the target
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            double time = static_cast<double>(target - position[i]) / speed[i];
            cars.push_back({position[i], time});
        }

        // Sort cars by position in descending order
        sort(cars.rbegin(), cars.rend());

        int fleets = 0;
        double lastTime = 0.0;

        // Iterate over the cars to determine the number of fleets
        for (const auto& car : cars) {
            double currentTime = car.second;

            // If a car's time is greater than the last recorded fleet time,
            // it means it forms a new fleet
            if (currentTime > lastTime) {
                fleets++;
                lastTime = currentTime;
            }
        }

        return fleets;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Preparation**: We first create a vector called `cars` to store each car's position and the time it takes to reach the target.
2. **Time Calculation**: For each car, the time to reach the target is calculated using the formula `(target - position[i]) / speed[i]`.
3. **Sorting**: The cars are sorted by their positions in descending order. This ensures that we iterate from the car closest to the target to the car furthest away.
4. **Fleet Calculation**: As we iterate over the cars:
   - If the current car's time is greater than the time of the last fleet, it forms a new fleet.
   - Otherwise, it catches up with the previous fleet.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since we need to store each car's position and time.

This solution efficiently calculates the number of car fleets using sorting and a greedy approach to group cars based on their arrival times.

Here's an optimized solution that uses a Monotonic Stack to efficiently calculate the number of car fleets:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int carFleet(int target, vector<int>& position, vector<int>& speed) {
        int n = position.size();
        vector<pair<int, double>> cars;

        // Calculate time to reach the target for each car
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            double time = static_cast<double>(target - position[i]) / speed[i];
            cars.push_back({position[i], time});
        }

        // Sort cars by position in descending order
        sort(cars.rbegin(), cars.rend());

        // Monotonic stack to keep track of car fleets
        stack<double> stack;

        // Iterate through the sorted cars
        for (const auto& car : cars) {
            double currentTime = car.second;

            // If the current car's time is greater than the top of the stack,
            // it means it forms a new fleet, so push it onto the stack
            if (stack.empty() || currentTime > stack.top()) {
                stack.push(currentTime);
            }
        }

        // The size of the stack gives the number of car fleets
        return stack.size();
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Time Calculation**: Each car's time to reach the target is calculated as before.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the cars in descending order by their positions.
3. **Monotonic Stack Usage**:
   - We use a **monotonic stack** to keep track of the times of car fleets.
   - If a car has a time greater than the time at the top of the stack, it forms a new fleet, and we push its time onto the stack.
   - If it has a time equal to or less than the time at the top, it will simply merge with the previous fleet, so we do nothing.
4. **Result**: The number of car fleets is equal to the size of the stack.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), primarily due to sorting the cars by their positions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the car times and using the monotonic stack.

Using the Monotonic Stack helps to keep track of the formation of fleets more intuitively by directly pushing and popping fleet times.
