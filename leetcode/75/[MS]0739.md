To solve this problem using a monotonic stack, you need to keep track of the temperatures' indices and determine the next warmer day for each day in the given `temperatures` array. Here’s an implementation of the solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& temperatures) {
        int dayNum = temperatures.size();
        stack<int> temperaturesStk;  // Monotonic stack to store indices of temperatures
        vector<int> waitingDays(dayNum, 0);  // Result vector initialized with 0

        for (int i = 0; i < dayNum; i++) {
            // While stack is not empty and current temperature is greater than the temperature at the index on top of the stack
            while (!temperaturesStk.empty() && temperatures[i] > temperatures[temperaturesStk.top()]) {
                int prevIndex = temperaturesStk.top();
                temperaturesStk.pop();
                waitingDays[prevIndex] = i - prevIndex;  // Calculate the difference in days
            }
            temperaturesStk.push(i);  // Push the current index onto the stack
        }

        return waitingDays;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Stack Usage**: The stack `temperaturesStk` is used to store the indices of temperatures in a **monotonic decreasing order**.
   - The stack helps in tracking the indices of days with temperatures that have not yet found a warmer future day.

2. **Loop**:
   - For each temperature at index `i`, if it is greater than the temperature at the index stored on top of the stack (`temperaturesStk.top()`), it means that we have found a warmer temperature for the day represented by that index.
   - We calculate the number of days between `i` (the current day) and the day on the top of the stack (`prevIndex`), and store it in the `waitingDays` result vector.

3. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is **O(n)** because each temperature is pushed onto the stack once and popped from the stack once.
   - The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the use of the stack to store indices.

This solution efficiently finds the number of days to wait for a warmer temperature for each day using a **monotonic stack** approach, which is well-suited for problems involving "next greater element."

The solution to the "Daily Temperatures" problem can be implemented both ways—iterating from left to right or from right to left. However, using a **reverse for loop** (starting from the end of the array and moving to the start) is often more straightforward for this type of problem, particularly when using a **monotonic stack**.

In this case, starting from the last day helps because:
1. We want to determine how many days ahead we need to wait for a warmer temperature.
2. By moving from right to left, we can keep track of the closest "warmer" day in a more efficient manner, without revisiting indices multiple times.

Here is an updated version of the code with the for loop starting from the last day and iterating backward:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& temperatures) {
        int dayNum = temperatures.size();
        stack<int> temperaturesStk;  // Monotonic stack to store indices
        vector<int> waitingDays(dayNum, 0);

        for (int i = dayNum - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Compare current temperature with the temperature stored in the stack
            while (!temperaturesStk.empty() && temperatures[i] >= temperatures[temperaturesStk.top()]) {
                temperaturesStk.pop();
            }

            if (!temperaturesStk.empty()) {
                waitingDays[i] = temperaturesStk.top() - i;  // Calculate how many days to wait
            }

            temperaturesStk.push(i);  // Push current index to the stack
        }

        return waitingDays;
    }
};
```

### Differences with the Reverse Iteration:
1. **Reverse Traversal**:
   - The loop now iterates from `dayNum - 1` to `0`, which makes it easier to directly compare the current day with any upcoming warmer days since we traverse from the end to the start.
  
2. **Calculating Wait Days**:
   - When a warmer day is found (`!temperaturesStk.empty()`), the difference between the current index and the index of the warmer day (`temperaturesStk.top()`) gives the number of days to wait.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Both methods (left to right and right to left) have a time complexity of **O(n)**.
   - However, the reverse iteration makes the logic slightly more intuitive when using a monotonic stack for problems that deal with finding the next greater element.

Using a reverse loop simplifies the process of determining how far in the future the next warmer day is, as the stack always maintains potential answers for upcoming days in the correct order.
