The `countSubstrings` function finds the total number of palindromic substrings in a given string. It uses an approach called **expanding around the center**.

1. **Center of Palindrome**: 
   - In this approach, each possible palindrome has a "center" that can either be a single character (for odd-length palindromes) or between two characters (for even-length palindromes).
   - For a string of length `n`, there are `2*n - 1` possible centers: `n` for odd-length palindromes and `n - 1` for even-length palindromes.

2. **Loop Explanation**:
   - The code loops through potential centers: `for (int center = 0; center < length * 2 - 1; ++center)`.
   - When `center` is even, it means the palindrome has an odd length, with the character at that index as its center.
   - When `center` is odd, it implies an even-length palindrome, with the center positioned between two characters.

3. **Left and Right Pointers**:
   - The `left` and `right` pointers are used to expand around the current center.
   - If `center` is even: `left == right`, indicating an odd-length palindrome starting from the character at `center/2`.
   - If `center` is odd: `right = left + 1`, indicating the start of an even-length palindrome.

4. **Expanding Around the Center**:
   - The while loop checks if the characters at the current `left` and `right` positions are the same. If they are:
     - The substring is palindromic.
     - It increments `totalCount` and moves `left` one step left and `right` one step right to continue expanding.

For example, consider `s = "aaa"`:
- The loop starts by expanding around every possible center.
- The palindromic substrings are counted, including single characters (`"a"`, `"a"`, `"a"`), double characters (`"aa"`, `"aa"`), and the whole string (`"aaa"`).
- The result will be 6, as there are six palindromic substrings.

This method allows checking both even and odd length palindromes, effectively covering all possibilities.
