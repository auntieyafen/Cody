1. **Heap-based Approach**: Using a max-heap to ensure we always place the most frequent character next in the result string. This avoids reversing the sort, and simplifies character placement.

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string reorganizeString(string s) {
        vector<int> counts(26, 0);
        for (char c : s)
            ++counts[c - 'a'];

        // Construct a max-heap based on character frequency
        priority_queue<pair<int, char>> maxHeap;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
            if (counts[i])
                maxHeap.push({counts[i], 'a' + i});

        string result;
        pair<int, char> prev = {0, ' '};  // Placeholder to hold the previous character

        // Build the result string
        while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
            auto [count, ch] = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();

            result += ch;
            if (prev.first > 0) {
                maxHeap.push(prev);
            }

            prev = {count - 1, ch};  // Decrease the count and keep for next iteration if still needed
        }

        // Check if the result is valid
        return result.size() == s.size() ? result : "";
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Count Frequencies**:
   - We first count the frequency of each character.
2. **Use Max-Heap**:
   - A max-heap (`priority_queue`) is used to always pick the character with the highest frequency next, ensuring no two adjacent characters are the same.
3. **Construct the Result**:
   - The previous character (`prev`) is stored to avoid consecutive placement. If the count is greater than 0 after placing, it is pushed back to the heap.
4. **Check for Validity**:
   - If the final result string has the same length as the input, we return it, otherwise return an empty string (`""`).

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log k)`, where `n` is the length of the string and `k` is the number of unique characters. Building the heap takes `O(k log k)` and extracting elements from the heap takes `O(n log k)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of unique characters, for storing heap elements.

This solution ensures better readability, reduces redundant operations, and provides an efficient and intuitive approach using a max-heap.
