### Overall Approach:
The function `decodeString(string s)` takes a string `s` with a pattern of repetitions and nested encodings and decodes it. The input string can contain digits, characters, and brackets (`[ ]`), and follows a format like `k[encoded_string]`. The objective is to output a decoded string based on the repetition defined.

### Key Elements of the Code:
- **Stacks**:
  - `repetitionsStack`: Stores the number of times to repeat a segment when a `[` is encountered.
  - `resultStack`: Stores the current string segment when a `[` is encountered to manage nested patterns.

- **String Parsing**:
  - **Digit Handling**: 
    - When the current character is a digit, the code builds the repetition count (`repetitions`), which accumulates until a `[` is reached.
  - **Bracket Handling**:
    - **`[` Opening Bracket**: 
      - When `[` is encountered, the current repetition and current string are pushed onto their respective stacks.
      - `repetitions` is then reset, and a new segment begins (`currentStr`).
    - **`]` Closing Bracket**:
      - When `]` is encountered, the code pops the top value from `repetitionsStack` to know how many times to repeat the current segment (`temp`).
      - The `currentStr` is reset to the value from `resultStack` and appended with repeated values of the segment.
  - **Character Handling**: 
    - When encountering regular alphabetic characters, the function adds them to the `currentStr`.

### Example to Illustrate:
Letâ€™s consider an example `3[a2[bc]]`.

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `3` is read, and it's the repetition count for the next segment.
   - `[`: Push `3` onto `repetitionsStack` and the current empty `currentStr` onto `resultStack`.

2. **Next Segment**:
   - `a` is read, and added to `currentStr`.
   - `2` is read: Push `2` onto `repetitionsStack`.
   - `[` is encountered again. The `currentStr` is `"a"` and is pushed onto the stack.

3. **Innermost Segment**:
   - `bc` is read.
   - `]`: Pop `2` from `repetitionsStack`, and repeat `bc` twice to form `"bcbc"`.
   - Append `"bcbc"` to `"a"` (from `resultStack`).

4. **Final Closing Bracket**:
   - Repeat `"abcbc"` three times, giving `"abcbcabcbcabcbc"`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed a constant number of times.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is `O(m)`, where `m` is the depth of the nested brackets. This space is used by the stacks to manage repetitions and nested patterns.

This iterative approach with stacks ensures that nested brackets and repetitive patterns are properly managed, reducing the risk of deep recursion and stack overflow errors.
