The parameter `std::function<int(int, int)> depthFirstSearch = [&](int i, int j) -> int` in the code may look strange, but it serves a practical purpose.

Here's why it's structured that way:

1. **Lambda Expression and Recursion**: 
   - The `depthFirstSearch` function is implemented as a lambda function, which allows you to define it inline. Lambdas are convenient for quick, localized implementations and make it possible to pass data without defining separate functions.
   
2. **Using `std::function`**: 
   - `std::function<int(int, int)>` is used because it is required for recursive lambda functions. In C++, a lambda cannot reference itself unless it's wrapped in a `std::function`, which allows for defining a callable object that can be recursive.
   
3. **Parameter `(int i, int j)`**:
   - The parameters `int i, int j` represent the coordinates in the 2D grid. The function takes these as inputs so that it knows which cell to process next.

4. **`[&]` Capture**:
   - The `[&]` capture allows the lambda to access external variables by reference, such as `grid`, `rows`, `cols`, and `directions`. This is useful for sharing context without needing to pass them explicitly as parameters every time.

Overall, this approach allows for a simple recursive implementation while avoiding the overhead of a named function outside the main function's scope. It keeps the logic localized, and `std::function` enables self-referential behavior, which makes recursion possible in a lambda.

Rewrite the depth-first search (DFS) function as a separate function outside the main function:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the maximum area of an island in a given grid
    int maxAreaOfIsland(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
        // Obtain the number of rows and columns of the grid
        int rows = grid.size(), cols = grid[0].size();
        int maxArea = 0;
        
        // Iterate through each cell of the grid
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    // Call depthFirstSearch and update maxArea
                    maxArea = std::max(maxArea, depthFirstSearch(grid, i, j, rows, cols));
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Return the final maximum area of an island found
        return maxArea;
    }

private:
    // Depth-first search function implemented as a separate function
    int depthFirstSearch(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, int rows, int cols) {
        // Base case: if the current cell is water (0), return 0 area
        if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Mark the current cell as visited by setting it to 0 and start counting the area from 1
        int area = 1;
        grid[i][j] = 0;

        // Directions array to explore all 4 neighbors (up, right, down, left)
        int directions[5] = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1};

        // Explore all 4 neighbor directions
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
            int x = i + directions[k];
            int y = j + directions[k + 1];

            // Check if the neighbor coordinates are within grid bounds
            if (x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols) {
                // Increment the area based on this recursive depth-first search
                area += depthFirstSearch(grid, x, y, rows, cols);
            }
        }

        // Return the area found for this island
        return area;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **`depthFirstSearch()` function**: Instead of using a lambda function, I wrote a separate member function `depthFirstSearch()` which performs DFS and returns the area of the island starting from cell `(i, j)`.
- **Parameters of `depthFirstSearch()`**:
  - `grid`: The 2D vector representing the grid.
  - `i` and `j`: Coordinates of the current cell.
  - `rows` and `cols`: Number of rows and columns of the grid to ensure boundary checks.
  
This refactoring makes the code cleaner by separating the DFS logic and makes it easier to read, maintain, and debug.

Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(M * N)`, where `M` is the number of rows and `N` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because in the worst case, the entire grid could be filled with land (1's), and we would need to explore every cell exactly once. The function `dfs` is called for each cell, but each cell is flipped to `0` once visited to avoid revisiting, ensuring each cell is processed only once.

Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(M * N)` in the worst case, due to the call stack size in the case of a deep recursion caused by a large contiguous island. This would happen if the grid is filled with land (1's) and we start the depth-first search from one corner of the grid, the recursion would reach the maximum depth equal to the number of cells in the grid before it begins to unwind.
