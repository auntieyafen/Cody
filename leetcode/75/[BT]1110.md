Here's an improved version of the given code that aims for better readability, efficiency, and reduced memory footprint:

1. The `toDeleteMarker` array is replaced by an unordered set for better efficiency, flexibility, and readability.
2. Removed the use of `std::function` to directly implement the `dfs` function as a member function, improving the readability and efficiency.
3. The code now uses references to avoid unnecessary copying of values.

Here is the improved version of your code:

```cpp
// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> delNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& toDelete) {
        unordered_set<int> toDeleteSet(toDelete.begin(), toDelete.end()); // Using a set for O(1) lookup.
        vector<TreeNode*> forest;
        
        // Helper function for DFS traversal and deletion.
        root = dfs(root, toDeleteSet, forest);
        if (root) {
            forest.push_back(root); // Add the root if it isn't deleted.
        }
        
        return forest;
    }

private:
    TreeNode* dfs(TreeNode* node, unordered_set<int>& toDeleteSet, vector<TreeNode*>& forest) {
        if (!node) return nullptr; // Base case: if the node is null.

        // Recursively process left and right children.
        node->left = dfs(node->left, toDeleteSet, forest);
        node->right = dfs(node->right, toDeleteSet, forest);

        // If the current node needs to be deleted.
        if (toDeleteSet.count(node->val)) {
            if (node->left) forest.push_back(node->left); // Add left child to forest if it exists.
            if (node->right) forest.push_back(node->right); // Add right child to forest if it exists.
            return nullptr; // Return null to indicate the node should be deleted.
        }
        
        // Return the current node if it's not deleted.
        return node;
    }
};
```

### Improvements:
1. **Using `unordered_set<int>`**:
   - The `toDeleteMarker` array is replaced by an `unordered_set<int>`. This is more flexible and allows efficient O(1) lookups for determining if a node value should be deleted.
   - The `unordered_set<int>` also avoids the need for a fixed-size array and provides a cleaner solution that works for any range of values.

2. **Removed `std::function`**:
   - The original implementation used a lambda function with `std::function`. In the new version, the `dfs` function is implemented as a private member function. This improves readability, avoids the overhead of `std::function`, and makes the code easier to understand.

3. **Improved Memory Efficiency**:
   - By passing the `toDeleteSet` and `forest` by reference to the `dfs` function, the code avoids unnecessary copying of data structures.

4. **Readability**:
   - The logic flow is simplified, and redundant comments have been removed, making the code more readable and concise.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: Each node is visited once, and each deletion is performed in constant time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The space complexity is due to the space needed for the result vector `forest`, the `toDeleteSet`, and the recursive call stack in the worst case. This is efficient given the problem constraints.
