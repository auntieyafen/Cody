You can solve the "Longest Consecutive Sequence" problem using the **Union-Find** (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) approach in **O(n)** time complexity. The key idea is to group numbers that are consecutive into a union-find data structure, and then find the size of the largest group.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Treat each element as its own group and union adjacent elements.
2. Use a map to store the parent of each element and find the size of each connected component.

Here's a rough implementation using Union-Find:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;

        unordered_map<int, int> parent;
        unordered_map<int, int> size;

        // Helper function to find the root with path compression
        function<int(int)> find = [&](int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            }
            return parent[x];
        };

        // Union function to merge two sets
        auto unionSets = [&](int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);
            if (rootX != rootY) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
                size[rootY] += size[rootX];
            }
        };

        // Initialize Union-Find structure
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (parent.find(num) == parent.end()) {
                parent[num] = num;
                size[num] = 1;
                if (parent.find(num - 1) != parent.end()) {
                    unionSets(num, num - 1);
                }
                if (parent.find(num + 1) != parent.end()) {
                    unionSets(num, num + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        // Find the maximum size among all sets
        int longestStreak = 0;
        for (auto& [key, value] : size) {
            longestStreak = max(longestStreak, value);
        }

        return longestStreak;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Union-Find Operations**:
  - **Find** with path compression helps to find the root of an element.
  - **Union** merges two disjoint sets.
- Each number is treated as its own group and then merged with adjacent numbers.
- The `find` and `union` operations both have amortized **O(1)** complexity, making the overall solution **O(n)**.

### Optimizations:
- Path compression and union by rank are used to speed up the operations.
- Using unordered maps helps to manage the dynamic nature of the input. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently group consecutive sequences and then determine the largest sequence size.

The method `numbersSet.count(num)` is used to check whether an element exists in an unordered set (`numbersSet`). If `num` is present in the set, it returns `1`, otherwise it returns `0`. Essentially, it checks for the presence of the value in the set.

In the context of the code, `numbersSet.count(num - 1)` checks if the value `num - 1` exists in the set, which helps determine if `num` is the start of a new sequence.
