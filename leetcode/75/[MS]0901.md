To solve the Stock Span problem efficiently, we can use a **monotonic stack**. Here is the implementation for the `StockSpanner` class:

```cpp
class StockSpanner {
public:
    // Stack to keep track of pairs (price, span).
    stack<pair<int, int>> st;

    StockSpanner() {
        // No initialization needed as stack is default empty.
    }

    int next(int price) {
        int span = 1; // Start with a span of 1 for the current day.

        // While the stack is not empty and the top price is less than or equal to the current price,
        // we pop the stack and add its span to the current span.
        while (!st.empty() && st.top().first <= price) {
            span += st.top().second;
            st.pop();
        }

        // Push the current price and its span onto the stack.
        st.push({price, span});

        return span;
    }
};

/**
 * Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * StockSpanner* obj = new StockSpanner();
 * int param_1 = obj->next(price);
 */
```

### Explanation:

- We use a **stack** to keep track of the prices and their respective spans.
- Each time we call the `next` method:
  - We start with a `span` of 1 for the current day.
  - We **pop elements from the stack** as long as the current price is **greater than or equal** to the price on the top of the stack. We add the popped element's span to the current `span`.
  - We then **push** the current price and its calculated `span` onto the stack.
  - Finally, we return the `span`.

### Example Walkthrough:
For input:
```cpp
["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
```
- `StockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();`
- `stockSpanner.next(100)` returns `1`.
  - Stack: [(100, 1)]
- `stockSpanner.next(80)` returns `1`.
  - Stack: [(100, 1), (80, 1)]
- `stockSpanner.next(60)` returns `1`.
  - Stack: [(100, 1), (80, 1), (60, 1)]
- `stockSpanner.next(70)` returns `2`.
  - Stack: [(100, 1), (80, 1), (70, 2)]
- `stockSpanner.next(60)` returns `1`.
  - Stack: [(100, 1), (80, 1), (70, 2), (60, 1)]
- `stockSpanner.next(75)` returns `4`.
  - Stack: [(100, 1), (80, 1), (75, 4)]
- `stockSpanner.next(85)` returns `6`.
  - Stack: [(100, 1), (85, 6)]

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)** amortized per call to `next`. Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of calls to `next`. This is because, in the worst case, we could end up storing all the elements in the stack.
