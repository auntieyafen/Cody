To solve this problem, we can take advantage of the following observations:

1. **Identify Larger Digits for Swapping**:
   - For each digit in the number, check if there’s a larger digit appearing later that could be swapped with it to get a bigger number.

2. **Maximize the Swap**:
   - If a larger digit is found, it should be the rightmost occurrence of that digit. This ensures that swapping yields the largest possible number.

3. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Start from the leftmost digit, and swap it with the largest digit that appears later in the number, ensuring only one swap to achieve the maximum possible number.

### Steps:

1. Convert the number to a list of its digits.
2. For each digit, look for the largest digit that appears after it.
3. If such a digit is found and is greater, swap the two digits.
4. After performing the swap (if any), convert the list of digits back to an integer.

Here’s the implementation in C++:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumSwap(int num) {
        // Convert num to a string for easy manipulation of digits
        string numStr = to_string(num);
        int n = numStr.size();
        
        // Create an array to store the last occurrence index of each digit
        int last[10] = {0};
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            last[numStr[i] - '0'] = i;
        }
        
        // Traverse through each digit to find the first position to swap
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // Check for a larger digit to swap with, starting from 9 down to the current digit+1
            for (int d = 9; d > numStr[i] - '0'; --d) {
                if (last[d] > i) {
                    // If a larger digit is found later in the string, swap them
                    swap(numStr[i], numStr[last[d]]);
                    // Return the result as integer after one swap
                    return stoi(numStr);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If no swap was made, return the original number
        return num;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Array `last`**: 
   - We store the last occurrence of each digit (0-9) in `last`, which helps us quickly check if there’s a larger digit we can swap with.
   
2. **Double Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates through each digit of `numStr`.
   - The inner loop checks from `9` down to the current digit to see if there’s a larger digit later in the string. This helps to quickly find the best digit to swap with to maximize the number.
   
3. **Early Return**:
   - As soon as we find a valid swap, we perform it, convert the string back to an integer, and return the result.

### Example Walkthrough

For `num = 2736`:
   - `last` array becomes: `[0,0,1,2,3,0,0,0,0,0]`.
   - Iterating through `numStr`:
     - For `i = 0` (`2`), check `9` down to `3`:
       - We find `7` at `last[7] = 1`, so we swap `2` with `7`.
   - Final number after swap: `7236`.
