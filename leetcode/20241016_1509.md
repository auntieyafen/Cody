To solve this problem, the key insight is that by performing at most three moves, we can adjust up to three of the largest or smallest elements to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum values. 

### Approach:
1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting `nums` helps us directly access the smallest and largest values in an ordered manner.
2. **Check for Edge Cases**: If the size of `nums` is less than or equal to 4, we can make all elements the same in at most three moves, so the difference will be 0.
3. **Calculate Possible Minimum Differences**:
   - After sorting, we consider four possible scenarios for achieving the smallest difference:
     1. Replace the three largest elements with the fourth largest (smallest values remain unchanged).
     2. Replace the two largest elements and the smallest element.
     3. Replace the largest element and the two smallest elements.
     4. Replace the three smallest elements with the fourth smallest (largest values remain unchanged).
   - In each case, calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum of the remaining elements.
4. **Return the Minimum Difference**: Among the four computed differences, the minimum one is our answer.

### Solution Code

Here's the implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n <= 4) return 0;  // If size is <= 4, we can make all elements equal in 3 moves.
        
        // Sort the array
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        // Calculate the minimum difference in the four possible scenarios
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        minDiff = min(minDiff, nums[n-1] - nums[3]);     // Replace three smallest elements
        minDiff = min(minDiff, nums[n-2] - nums[2]);     // Replace two smallest and one largest
        minDiff = min(minDiff, nums[n-3] - nums[1]);     // Replace one smallest and two largest
        minDiff = min(minDiff, nums[n-4] - nums[0]);     // Replace three largest elements
        
        return minDiff;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: Sorting helps arrange elements in ascending order to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Calculations**:
   - `nums[n-1] - nums[3]`: After replacing the first three elements with the fourth smallest.
   - `nums[n-2] - nums[2]`: After replacing the smallest and largest two.
   - `nums[n-3] - nums[1]`: After replacing two smallest and one largest.
   - `nums[n-4] - nums[0]`: After replacing the last three elements with the fourth largest.

3. **Result**: `minDiff` stores the smallest difference among these four configurations.

This solution runs in \(O(n \log n)\) due to sorting, which is optimal for this problem.
