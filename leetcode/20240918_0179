The solution you provided for the "Largest Number" problem is well-written and efficient, but there are a few potential improvements or optimizations you can make. I'll explain them below:

### 1. **Avoid Redundant Conversion**
Instead of creating a new vector `snums` to hold the string versions of `nums`, you can directly work on `nums` itself by sorting with a custom comparator. This will save space and avoid unnecessary string operations during the initial conversion.

### 2. **Efficient String Concatenation**
While concatenating strings in a loop like `res += s` works fine, you could use a `stringstream` to potentially make the concatenation faster for large inputs.

### Optimized Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string largestNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Custom comparator to sort the numbers in the desired order
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [](int a, int b) {
            string sa = to_string(a), sb = to_string(b);
            return sa + sb > sb + sa; // Sort based on concatenated result
        });

        // Handle the edge case where the largest number would be "0"
        if (nums[0] == 0) return "0";

        // Efficient concatenation of the sorted numbers
        stringstream res;
        for (int num : nums) {
            res << num;
        }

        return res.str();
    }
};
```

### Improvements:

1. **Avoid Extra Vector**: Instead of creating `snums`, the comparator works directly on the integers. This reduces the space complexity slightly, as we don't need an additional vector of strings.
   
2. **Custom Comparator**: The sorting logic remains the same. We concatenate `a + b` and `b + a` in the comparator to determine the correct order of elements, which ensures that the result is lexicographically largest.

3. **Edge Case**: We handle the case where the result is `"0"` by checking if the first number is `0` after sorting. If the largest number is `0`, the entire result must be `"0"`.

4. **Efficient Concatenation**: Using a `stringstream` for concatenation can improve performance, especially when working with large numbers of elements, as it avoids multiple reallocations.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n log n)**: Sorting dominates the time complexity, where `n` is the number of integers in `nums`. String comparisons during sorting are bounded by the maximum number of digits in the integers.
  
### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We only store the sorted numbers and the result string.
