Your current approach uses dynamic programming and compares each substring of the input string `s` with every word in the `dictionary`. While this solution is correct, it can be slow, especially if the dictionary is large, due to the repeated use of `s.substr(i, len)` and the nested loops.

### Optimizations:
1. **Trie Data Structure**: You can replace the dictionary lookup with a Trie (prefix tree) to improve the time complexity. Instead of iterating through each word in the dictionary for each position, you can traverse the Trie to match words efficiently.
2. **Memoization**: Memoizing the results of overlapping subproblems can further speed up the solution.

### Optimized Code Using Trie and Memoization:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    struct TrieNode {
        TrieNode* children[26] = {nullptr};
        bool isWord = false;
    };

    void insert(TrieNode* root, const string& word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (char c : word) {
            int idx = c - 'a';
            if (!node->children[idx]) {
                node->children[idx] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[idx];
        }
        node->isWord = true;
    }

    int minExtraChar(string s, vector<string>& dictionary) {
        int n = s.size();
        TrieNode* root = new TrieNode();
        for (const string& word : dictionary) {
            insert(root, word);
        }

        // dp[i] will hold the minimum extra characters needed to split s[0..i-1]
        vector<int> dp(n+1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Case where we treat s[i] as an extra character
            dp[i+1] = min(dp[i+1], dp[i] + 1);
            
            // Search for dictionary words starting from s[i]
            TrieNode* node = root;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                int idx = s[j] - 'a';
                if (!node->children[idx]) break; // No match in Trie
                node = node->children[idx];
                if (node->isWord) {
                    dp[j+1] = min(dp[j+1], dp[i]); // Found a valid word in dictionary
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Trie Construction**: A Trie is used to store the dictionary, allowing for faster lookup of possible words.
2. **Efficient Word Matching**: Instead of checking every word in the dictionary for each position in `s`, the Trie allows you to efficiently check for words starting from each position.
3. **DP Optimization**: We continue to use dynamic programming to store the minimum extra characters for each position but avoid repetitive substring comparisons.

### Time Complexity:
- **Trie Construction**: \( O(M \times L) \), where \( M \) is the number of words in the dictionary and \( L \) is the average length of a word.
- **DP Loop with Trie Search**: \( O(N \times L) \), where \( N \) is the length of the input string `s` and \( L \) is the average length of dictionary words (in the worst case, each character is part of a word in the dictionary).

This approach should be faster than your initial solution, especially when the dictionary is large.
