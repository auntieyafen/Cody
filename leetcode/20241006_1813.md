### Code Explanation

The function `areSentencesSimilar` takes two input strings, `sentence1` and `sentence2`. The goal is to determine if `sentence1` and `sentence2` are "similar" by meeting the following conditions:

1. **Prefix and Suffix Match**: 
   - We want `sentence1` to be able to match the beginning (prefix) and the end (suffix) of `sentence2` (or vice versa).
2. **Length Requirement**: 
   - The middle parts of the longer sentence can be ignored if the prefix and suffix combined cover the shorter sentence.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

```cpp
vector<string> words1, words2;
istringstream iss1(sentence1), iss2(sentence2);
string word;
```
- `words1` and `words2` are vectors used to store the individual words from each sentence.
- `istringstream` is used to parse each sentence by splitting it at spaces to get individual words.
  
```cpp
while (iss1 >> word) words1.push_back(word);
while (iss2 >> word) words2.push_back(word);
```
- These loops split `sentence1` and `sentence2` into words, placing each word in `words1` and `words2`, respectively.

```cpp
if (words1.size() > words2.size()) swap(words1, words2);
```
- We make sure `words1` refers to the shorter sentence, which makes later calculations simpler. 
- If `words1` is longer, `swap` switches the contents of `words1` and `words2`.

```cpp
int prefixMatch = 0, suffixMatch = 0;
int n1 = words1.size(), n2 = words2.size();
```
- `prefixMatch` and `suffixMatch` are counters to track how many words match at the beginning (prefix) and end (suffix) between the two sentences.
- `n1` and `n2` store the lengths of `words1` and `words2`.

#### Prefix Matching Loop
```cpp
while (prefixMatch < n1 && words1[prefixMatch] == words2[prefixMatch]) 
    prefixMatch++;
```
- This loop counts the matching words from the start of `words1` and `words2`.
- `prefixMatch` increments as long as the words at each index match and we haven’t reached the end of `words1`.

#### Suffix Matching Loop
```cpp
while (suffixMatch < n1 - prefixMatch && words1[n1 - 1 - suffixMatch] == words2[n2 - 1 - suffixMatch]) 
    suffixMatch++;
```
- This loop counts the matching words from the end of `words1` and `words2`.
- `suffixMatch` increments as long as the words match from the back of both sentences.
- The condition `suffixMatch < n1 - prefixMatch` ensures we don’t double-count overlapping words if they match in both the prefix and suffix.

#### Final Condition
```cpp
return prefixMatch + suffixMatch == n1;
```
- Here, we check if the total number of matching words (prefix + suffix) equals the length of `words1` (the shorter sentence).
- If true, `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar, so we return `true`.
- If not, we return `false`, meaning the sentences don’t meet the similarity criteria. 

### Summary
The algorithm efficiently checks if `sentence1` and `sentence2` have matching words at their start and end to cover the entire shorter sentence, allowing them to be "similar." It has a linear runtime complexity, O(n), because it only makes one pass through each word in both sentences.
