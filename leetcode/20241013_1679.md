Let's debug the code you provided for the `maxOperations` function. The goal of the function is to count how many pairs of numbers in the `nums` vector can be summed to equal `k`. The following are common issues and improvements that can be made to your code.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Using an unordered_map for Index Tracking**: You are using `unordered_map` to track the indices of numbers. However, since you sort the `nums` vector, the original indices no longer correspond to the values in the sorted array.

2. **Modifying the `nums` Vector**: When you change `nums[i]` to `-100`, you are also altering the values that might be needed for further iterations. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Redundant Searching**: You're checking for complements every time in the `numMap`, but after you change values in `nums`, the corresponding indices may not be valid anymore.

4. **Pair Counting Logic**: The logic to count pairs should ensure that each element is only used once in pairs, but the current implementation may not prevent that correctly.

### Revised Code

Let's fix these issues and provide a clean implementation that uses a frequency map to count pairs:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;

        // Fill frequency map with the counts of each number
        for (int num : nums) {
            freqMap[num]++;
        }

        for (int num : nums) {
            int complement = k - num;
            // Only process if num is still in the map (has not been paired)
            if (freqMap[num] > 0 && freqMap[complement] > 0) {
                // If num and complement are the same, we need at least two of them
                if (num == complement) {
                    // Count pairs of the same number
                    ans += freqMap[num] / 2;
                    freqMap[num] = 0; // All are paired
                } else {
                    // Count pairs of different numbers
                    int pairs = min(freqMap[num], freqMap[complement]);
                    ans += pairs;
                    freqMap[num] -= pairs; // Decrease count of num
                    freqMap[complement] -= pairs; // Decrease count of complement
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Revised Code

1. **Frequency Map**: We use a frequency map (`freqMap`) to count occurrences of each number in `nums`. This allows us to efficiently check how many times we can form pairs that sum to `k`.

2. **Pair Counting Logic**:
   - We check for each number if its complement exists in the map.
   - If the number and its complement are the same (like pairs of 5 to make 10), we can form pairs from half of their count.
   - If they are different, we count the minimum of their frequencies to determine how many pairs can be formed.

3. **No Modification to `nums`**: We avoid modifying the original `nums` array, ensuring that our logic works correctly on the counts stored in the frequency map.

### Conclusion

This revised solution should work correctly to count the maximum number of operations (or pairs) that can be formed where each pair sums to `k`. You can test it with various inputs to confirm that it produces the expected results.

To solve the problem of counting the maximum number of operations where we can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals a given integer \( k \) and remove them, we can utilize a frequency map to track the occurrences of each number in the array. This allows us to efficiently find pairs that can be removed while handling duplicates correctly.

### Approach:

1. **Use a Frequency Map**: Count the frequency of each number in the array using an unordered map (or hash table).

2. **Iterate Over Unique Elements**: For each unique element in the frequency map, check if its complement (the number needed to reach \( k \)) exists in the map.

3. **Count the Pairs**:
   - If the number and its complement are the same (for example, when \( k \) is even), we can only form \( \text{count} / 2 \) pairs.
   - If they are different, the number of pairs formed will be the minimum of their counts.

4. **Return the Total Number of Operations**: Sum up the pairs found to get the maximum number of operations.

### Implementation:

Here's how this can be implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> frequency;
        int operations = 0;

        // Count the frequency of each number
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequency[num]++;
        }

        // Iterate through unique elements in the frequency map
        for (const auto& [num, count] : frequency) {
            int complement = k - num;
            // Check if complement exists in the map
            if (frequency.find(complement) != frequency.end()) {
                if (num == complement) {
                    // If the number and complement are the same
                    operations += count / 2;
                } else if (num < complement) {  // To avoid double counting
                    operations += min(count, frequency[complement]);
                }
            }
        }

        return operations;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;

    // Test case 1
    vector<int> nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int k1 = 5;
    cout << "Output for nums1: " << sol.maxOperations(nums1, k1) << " (Expected: 2)" << endl;

    // Test case 2
    vector<int> nums2 = {3, 1, 3, 4, 3};
    int k2 = 6;
    cout << "Output for nums2: " << sol.maxOperations(nums2, k2) << " (Expected: 1)" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Counting Frequencies**: We first loop through `nums` and store the frequency of each number in an unordered map.

2. **Finding Pairs**:
   - We iterate over each unique number in the frequency map.
   - For each number, we compute its complement.
   - If the complement is found, we either count pairs:
     - If `num` is the same as `complement`, we can form \( \text{count} / 2 \) pairs.
     - If they are different, we count pairs as the minimum of their counts. The check `num < complement` ensures that we don't count the same pair twice.

3. **Returning the Result**: The total number of operations is returned as the final result.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in `nums`, since we traverse the array and the frequency map at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for the frequency map. 

This solution efficiently counts the maximum number of operations possible while handling edge cases, such as duplicates and varying complements.
