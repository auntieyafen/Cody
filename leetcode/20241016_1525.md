To make this solution even more efficient, we can reduce some redundant steps in counting and checking unique characters. Instead of using `unordered_map` to count characters for left and right sections, we can use two `vector<int>` arrays (since there are only 26 possible lowercase characters).

Here's an optimized version that uses two `vector<int>` arrays and tracks unique characters by counting distinct elements directly.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numSplits(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        
        // Arrays to keep track of character counts on left and right sides
        vector<int> leftCount(26, 0), rightCount(26, 0);
        
        int distinctLeft = 0, distinctRight = 0, ans = 0;

        // Initialize right side with all characters in `s`
        for (char c : s) {
            if (rightCount[c - 'a']++ == 0) distinctRight++;
        }

        // Iterate over each split point
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            char c = s[i];
            
            // Move character from right to left
            if (++leftCount[c - 'a'] == 1) distinctLeft++;  // New unique in left
            if (--rightCount[c - 'a'] == 0) distinctRight--; // Remove unique from right
            
            // Count good split
            if (distinctLeft == distinctRight) {
                ans++;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Optimizations

1. **Character Tracking Using Fixed-Size Arrays**: Since there are only 26 lowercase English letters, using arrays instead of hash maps reduces lookup time and improves cache efficiency.
2. **Efficient Updates on Splitting Characters**: Instead of creating new `unordered_map` objects or removing elements explicitly, we simply increment or decrement counts in `leftCount` and `rightCount`.
3. **Direct Counting of Distinct Elements**: By directly managing `distinctLeft` and `distinctRight` counters, we avoid recomputation and gain efficiency.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), as we still only traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since the character arrays are fixed at 26 elements each.

This solution is both simpler and faster than the previous one, leveraging the fact that the number of unique characters is limited.
