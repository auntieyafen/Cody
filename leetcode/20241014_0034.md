In C++, you can use `{}` to return a `std::vector` in a shorthand way, known as *brace-enclosed initializer lists*. When you return `{firstIdx, lastIdx}`, the compiler interprets this as creating a temporary `std::vector<int>` containing the elements `firstIdx` and `lastIdx`, so you don’t need to explicitly write `std::vector<int>{firstIdx, lastIdx}`.

Here’s how it works in the context of your code:

```cpp
return {firstIdx, lastIdx};
```

### How `{}` Works

The syntax `{}` is an *initializer list* that allows you to initialize aggregate types like vectors, arrays, or structures directly. It’s essentially shorthand for:

```cpp
return std::vector<int>{firstIdx, lastIdx};
```

This syntax is a convenient way to directly initialize and return a vector without creating a named vector object, making the code more concise and readable.

### Requirements

For this shorthand to work:
1. The return type of the function must be a vector (e.g., `std::vector<int>`).
2. The list inside `{}` must match the element type of the vector (in this case, `int`).

This is supported in C++11 and later standards.
