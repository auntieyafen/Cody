This code aims to find the maximum possible decimal number by concatenating binary representations of integers from a list, `nums`. The strategy involves converting each integer to binary, sorting these binary strings to maximize the concatenated result, and then interpreting the concatenated binary result as a decimal integer.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Convert Each Integer to Binary**: 
   ```cpp
   for (int num : nums) {
       string binStr = "";
       while (num > 0) {
           binStr = to_string(num % 2) + binStr;
           num /= 2;
       }
       binStrs.push_back(binStr);
   }
   ```
   - This loop iterates over each integer in `nums`, converting it to its binary string representation.
   - For each `num`, a binary string `binStr` is constructed by repeatedly calculating the remainder of `num` when divided by 2 (`num % 2`), appending each bit to the front of `binStr`.

2. **Sort Binary Strings for Maximum Concatenation**:
   ```cpp
   sort(binStrs.begin(), binStrs.end(), [](const string& a, const string& b) {
       return a + b > b + a;
   });
   ```
   - The binary strings in `binStrs` are sorted using a custom comparator.
   - For two strings `a` and `b`, it checks if `a + b` is lexicographically greater than `b + a`. This ensures that when sorted, the concatenation will yield the largest possible binary sequence.

3. **Concatenate the Sorted Binary Strings**:
   ```cpp
   string result = "";
   for (const string& binStr : binStrs) {
       result += binStr;
   }
   ```
   - After sorting, the binary strings are concatenated in order to form a single binary string, `result`, which represents the maximum possible number in binary form.

4. **Convert the Concatenated Binary String to Decimal**:
   ```cpp
   for (char c : result) {
       maxNum = maxNum * 2 + (c - '0');
   }
   ```
   - This loop converts `result` from a binary string to a decimal integer.
   - `maxNum` is initialized to zero and updated by multiplying by 2 (bit-shifting left) and adding the integer value of each binary character (`c - '0'`).

5. **Return the Result**:
   ```cpp
   return maxNum;
   ```
   - The final value of `maxNum`, representing the maximum possible decimal number derived from the binary concatenation, is returned.

### Summary
The code effectively:
1. Converts integers to binary strings.
2. Sorts the binary strings to maximize the concatenated result.
3. Concatenates the sorted binary strings.
4. Converts the binary result back to a decimal integer for the final answer.
