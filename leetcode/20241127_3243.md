For this problem, we need to efficiently update the shortest distance from city 0 to city `n - 1` after adding each new road as per the given queries.

Here's one approach to solve this problem using Dijkstra's algorithm and updating the graph dynamically with each new road addition:

Here's a solution to calculate the shortest path efficiently while dynamically adding roads:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> shortestDistanceAfterQueries(int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        // Initial adjacency list for the cities
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            adj[i].push_back(i + 1);
        }
        
        vector<int> shortestDistance;
        
        for (auto& query : queries) {
            int u = query[0], v = query[1];
            adj[u].push_back(v);

            shortestDistance.push_back(bfsShortestPath(adj, n));
        }

        return shortestDistance;
    }

private:
    // Helper function to compute shortest path from 0 to n-1 using BFS
    int bfsShortestPath(vector<vector<int>>& adj, int n) {
        vector<int> distance(n, INT_MAX);
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(0);
        distance[0] = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
                if (distance[neighbor] == INT_MAX) {
                    distance[neighbor] = distance[node] + 1;
                    q.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        return distance[n - 1];
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The initial graph is represented as an adjacency list.
   - The given queries are applied sequentially to add roads dynamically.

2. **BFS for Shortest Path Calculation:**
   - After each query, we calculate the shortest path from city `0` to city `n - 1` using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
   - BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

3. **Time Complexity:**
   - This approach has a time complexity of `O(queries * (V + E))` where `V` is the number of cities and `E` is the number of edges. This can be slow for larger values of `n` and a high number of queries. However, it's simple and straightforward to implement.

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Use of Union-Find / Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - You could use a more sophisticated approach like DSU to keep track of the shortest paths if the graph structure allows for it.
  
2. **Dynamic Shortest Path Algorithms:**
   - Consider using algorithms like Johnson's algorithm or other advanced methods for dynamically updating shortest paths to optimize performance further.
