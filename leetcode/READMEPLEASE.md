### Please remember in interview

#### Routine
1. Ask constraint
2. Variable name
3. Think brute force first and say its time & space complexity
4. Ask the interviewer if I can start coding
5. Talking when still thinking (they may give more hints)
6. Add title to the notes like `Intuition`, `Observation`, `Constraint` and `Implementation`
7. Think more case and edge case
8. Test your algorithm with example

#### C++
* Remember to add `std::`
* You may use `static`
* `const + pass by reference`: Ensuring Parameters Are Not Modified and Avoiding Unnecessary Copies

GO for it!
