To solve this problem, we need to identify and remove all methods in the project that are either directly or indirectly dependent on a specific bug-prone method \( k \). Additionally, no method outside of the suspicious group should invoke any of these methods.

### Key Steps to Solve the Problem
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent each method as a node and each invocation as a directed edge from one node to another. This allows us to use graph traversal techniques to find dependencies.
  
2. **Identifying Suspicious Methods**: Use DFS or BFS starting from method \( k \) to identify all nodes (methods) reachable from \( k \). These reachable nodes are our "suspicious methods."

3. **Check for Incoming Edges from Outside**: Once we identify the suspicious group, we need to check if any node not in this group has an invocation edge pointing to a node in this group. If there is any such edge, the group cannot be removed, and we should return all methods.

4. **Output Remaining Methods**: If the suspicious group has no external invocations, remove it from the total set of methods and return the remaining methods.

### Code Implementation
Here’s how we can implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> remainingMethods(int n, int k, vector<vector<int>>& invocations) {
        // Step 1: Represent invocations in an adjacency list
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n), reverseAdj(n);
        for (auto& inv : invocations) {
            adj[inv[0]].push_back(inv[1]);         // Normal adjacency for reachability
            reverseAdj[inv[1]].push_back(inv[0]);   // Reverse adjacency to check incoming links
        }
        
        // Step 2: Identify all methods reachable from k (suspicious methods)
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        unordered_set<int> suspicious;
        dfs(k, adj, visited, suspicious);
        
        // Step 3: Check if any external methods invoke any suspicious method
        for (int node : suspicious) {
            for (int prev : reverseAdj[node]) {
                if (!suspicious.count(prev)) {
                    // If any external method invokes a suspicious method, return all methods
                    vector<int> allMethods(n);
                    iota(allMethods.begin(), allMethods.end(), 0);
                    return allMethods;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Step 4: Return remaining methods if all suspicious methods are isolated
        vector<int> remaining;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!suspicious.count(i)) {
                remaining.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        return remaining;
    }

private:
    void dfs(int node, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited, unordered_set<int>& suspicious) {
        if (visited[node]) return;
        visited[node] = true;
        suspicious.insert(node);
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            dfs(neighbor, adj, visited, suspicious);
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Solution
1. **Graph Creation**:
   - `adj`: Standard adjacency list for forward traversal.
   - `reverseAdj`: Reverse adjacency list to check if any node outside the suspicious set has links to it.

2. **DFS for Suspicious Group**:
   - `dfs`: Standard DFS that marks all methods reachable from \( k \) and stores them in the `suspicious` set.

3. **External Invocation Check**:
   - For each node in `suspicious`, check its reverse neighbors in `reverseAdj`. If any reverse neighbor is outside `suspicious`, we cannot remove the suspicious group, and we return all methods.

4. **Return Remaining Methods**:
   - If no external links are found, iterate through all methods and add the non-suspicious ones to the result.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n + m) \), where \( n \) is the number of methods and \( m \) is the number of invocations, as we perform DFS traversals and adjacency checks.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n + m) \), for storing adjacency lists and visited state.

This solution efficiently handles the requirements of the problem, ensuring that we only return the modified set of methods if no external method calls into the suspicious group.


///

Here’s a more optimized approach that leverages BFS for detecting the suspicious group and skips redundant checks. By structuring the code to exit early if an external invocation into the suspicious group is found, we can potentially improve performance.

### Optimized Solution

This approach still uses adjacency lists, but instead of a DFS for suspicious method detection, it uses BFS for faster traversal. The early exit condition when an external dependency is detected further reduces runtime.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> remainingMethods(int n, int k, vector<vector<int>>& invocations) {
        // Step 1: Build adjacency and reverse adjacency lists
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n), reverseAdj(n);
        for (auto& inv : invocations) {
            adj[inv[0]].push_back(inv[1]);
            reverseAdj[inv[1]].push_back(inv[0]);
        }

        // Step 2: BFS to identify all methods reachable from k (suspicious methods)
        unordered_set<int> suspicious;
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(k);
        suspicious.insert(k);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int curr = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for (int neighbor : adj[curr]) {
                if (suspicious.insert(neighbor).second) {
                    q.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Check for any external invocations to suspicious methods
        for (int method : suspicious) {
            for (int invoker : reverseAdj[method]) {
                if (!suspicious.count(invoker)) {
                    // If there's an external invocation, return all methods
                    vector<int> allMethods(n);
                    iota(allMethods.begin(), allMethods.end(), 0);
                    return allMethods;
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Return remaining methods if no external dependencies
        vector<int> remaining;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!suspicious.count(i)) {
                remaining.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        return remaining;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Optimizations
1. **BFS for Suspicious Detection**:
   - Using BFS instead of DFS for traversing the methods can reduce call stack depth, making it more efficient and manageable in larger inputs.
   - The `suspicious` set checks for duplicates in `O(1)` time, which avoids re-processing nodes.

2. **Early Exit on External Invocation Detection**:
   - Instead of waiting to check all suspicious methods for external invocations, we check immediately and exit as soon as an external invocation is found, reducing unnecessary checks.

3. **Efficient Remaining Methods Collection**:
   - Using the `suspicious` set, we only iterate once over the methods to gather the remaining non-suspicious ones.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n + m) \), similar to the original solution, but with potentially reduced overhead due to early exits and BFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n + m) \), mainly for adjacency lists and BFS queue. 

This optimized approach should be faster for large inputs, especially when there are early exits due to external dependencies.


///


For an even faster solution, we can reduce the number of checks by performing the following optimizations:

1. **Detect Suspicious Methods Using DFS (or BFS) and Mark In-place**: Instead of using an additional set or map, we can mark suspicious methods directly on an array, cutting down on memory overhead.
2. **Check External Invocations Early and Skip Entirely if Any Found**: During the marking step, if we detect any method outside the suspicious set that calls into it, we can immediately return all methods.
3. **Return Remaining Methods Directly**: Once marking is complete and no external invocations are found, collect all methods that aren’t marked suspicious.

Here’s the implementation with these optimizations:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> remainingMethods(int n, int k, vector<vector<int>>& invocations) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n), reverseAdj(n);
        vector<bool> isSuspicious(n, false);
        
        // Build adjacency lists
        for (const auto& inv : invocations) {
            adj[inv[0]].push_back(inv[1]);
            reverseAdj[inv[1]].push_back(inv[0]);
        }
        
        // Step 1: Mark all methods reachable from k as suspicious using DFS
        stack<int> stack;
        stack.push(k);
        
        while (!stack.empty()) {
            int curr = stack.top();
            stack.pop();
            if (!isSuspicious[curr]) {
                isSuspicious[curr] = true;
                for (int neighbor : adj[curr]) {
                    if (!isSuspicious[neighbor]) {
                        stack.push(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Check if any external invocation points to a suspicious method
        for (int method = 0; method < n; ++method) {
            if (isSuspicious[method]) {
                for (int invoker : reverseAdj[method]) {
                    if (!isSuspicious[invoker]) {
                        // External invocation detected, return all methods
                        vector<int> allMethods(n);
                        iota(allMethods.begin(), allMethods.end(), 0);
                        return allMethods;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Step 3: Collect non-suspicious methods
        vector<int> remaining;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!isSuspicious[i]) remaining.push_back(i);
        }
        
        return remaining;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Further Optimizations

1. **Direct Marking in `isSuspicious` Array**: We use an array `isSuspicious` to mark suspicious methods directly, avoiding the extra memory and lookup time of a hash set.
2. **Immediate Return on External Invocation Detection**: During the marking phase, if we detect any external invocation pointing into the suspicious methods, we can exit early, avoiding extra traversal.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n + m) \), where \( m \) is the number of invocations, since we traverse each invocation and node at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n + m) \), primarily for adjacency lists and the `isSuspicious` array.

This approach minimizes runtime and space usage further by reducing extra checks and exiting early where possible.
