A more optimized solution skips using extra storage for words by directly iterating through the string and checking character conditions as it traverses each word:

1. Start by checking if the sentence begins and ends with the same character.
2. Traverse the sentence. Each time a space is encountered, ensure the last character of the previous word matches the first character of the next word.

Here’s the implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isCircularSentence(string sentence) {
        int n = sentence.size();
        
        // Check if the sentence starts and ends with the same character
        if (sentence[0] != sentence[n - 1]) return false;

        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (sentence[i] == ' ') {
                // Check if the last character of the current word matches the first of the next
                if (sentence[i - 1] != sentence[i + 1]) return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- **Single Pass**: It directly verifies conditions while iterating through the sentence, avoiding extra storage for splitting.
- **Efficiency**: With \(O(n)\) time and \(O(1)\) space complexity, this approach is optimal for checking circular sentences.

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that each word in the sentence links properly to the next word (circularly). Here’s a straightforward approach:

1. **Split the sentence into words**.
2. **Check each word** to see if the last character matches the first character of the next word.
3. **Circular Check**: Ensure the last character of the last word matches the first character of the first word.

Here’s a potential solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isCircularSentence(string sentence) {
        vector<string> words;
        stringstream ss(sentence);
        string word;
        
        // Split the sentence into words
        while (ss >> word) {
            words.push_back(word);
        }
        
        int n = words.size();
        
        // Check the circular condition for each adjacent pair
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (words[i].back() != words[(i + 1) % n].front()) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- **Splitting the Sentence**: We use a `stringstream` to split `sentence` into individual words.
- **Circular Condition**: We check each word's last character against the first character of the following word, using `(i + 1) % n` to wrap around for the last word and the first word.
  
### Complexity
- **Time**: \(O(n)\) for iterating through words, where \(n\) is the number of words.
- **Space**: \(O(n)\) for storing words in a vector.
