To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue (min-heap) to track the smallest available chair numbers efficiently. Here’s the plan:

1. **Sort `times` by arrival time**: We sort the `times` array so we can handle arrivals and departures in order.

2. **Track available chairs with a min-heap**: A min-heap helps us quickly find the smallest unoccupied chair.

3. **Track occupied chairs**: Use another min-heap to keep track of when each chair becomes available as friends leave.

4. **Allocate and release chairs**: As each friend arrives, assign them the smallest available chair. When they leave, release the chair back to the available chairs heap.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int smallestChair(vector<vector<int>>& times, int targetFriend) {
        int targetArrival = times[targetFriend][0];

        // Sort by arrival times
        sort(times.begin(), times.end());

        // Min-heaps to track the smallest available chair and occupied chairs by leave time
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> availableChairs;
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> occupiedChairs;

        // Initially, all chairs (starting with chair 0) are available in order
        for (int i = 0; i < times.size(); ++i) {
            availableChairs.push(i);
        }

        // Go through each friend's arrival and leaving times
        for (const auto& time : times) {
            int arrival = time[0];
            int leaving = time[1];

            // Free up chairs for friends who have left by the current arrival time
            while (!occupiedChairs.empty() && occupiedChairs.top().first <= arrival) {
                availableChairs.push(occupiedChairs.top().second);
                occupiedChairs.pop();
            }

            // Assign the smallest available chair
            int assignedChair = availableChairs.top();
            availableChairs.pop();

            // If this is the target friend, return the chair number
            if (arrival == targetArrival) {
                return assignedChair;
            }

            // Record the leaving time for the current friend with their assigned chair
            occupiedChairs.push({leaving, assignedChair});
        }

        return -1; // This should not be reached
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Sort the friends by arrival times** to ensure we process them in the correct order.

2. **Use two min-heaps**:
   - `availableChairs` tracks the smallest chair numbers that are currently unoccupied.
   - `occupiedChairs` is a priority queue of pairs where the first element is the leave time and the second element is the chair number. This allows us to free chairs in time order.

3. **Allocate and free chairs**:
   - Before assigning a chair to the current arriving friend, we release any chairs that have been freed by friends who have already left.
   - Assign the smallest available chair to the friend.

4. **Return the chair number** when reaching the `targetFriend`'s arrival time.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) due to sorting and priority queue operations.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) to store the chairs in the priority queues. 

This solution ensures an efficient and accurate result for finding the chair assigned to the target friend.

We use priority queues (min-heaps) here because they allow us to efficiently manage and retrieve the smallest available chair number and handle chair release times in a sorted manner. Let’s break down why each queue is used:

1. **Min-Heap for Available Chairs (`availableChairs`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This min-heap helps us quickly retrieve the smallest unoccupied chair number, ensuring that friends sit on the lowest-numbered chair available.
   - **Why Min-Heap**: Since friends prefer the smallest numbered chair, a min-heap allows us to always pop the smallest chair efficiently in \(O(\log k)\), where \(k\) is the number of chairs currently available.
   - **Operation**: When a friend leaves, we push their chair number back into the min-heap, making it available for others.

2. **Min-Heap for Occupied Chairs (`occupiedChairs`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This min-heap keeps track of which chairs become available and at what time, sorted by leave times.
   - **Why Min-Heap**: We need to release chairs in the order of friends’ leaving times. By using a min-heap, the chair that becomes available the earliest is always at the top of the heap. This allows us to pop chairs that are now free, ensuring we don’t miss any empty chairs or assign an occupied one.
   - **Operation**: When a friend arrives, we first check if any chairs have been freed up by popping from `occupiedChairs` as long as the top entry’s leaving time is less than or equal to the current arrival time.

### Benefits of Using Priority Queues
- **Efficiency**: Both `availableChairs` and `occupiedChairs` priority queues allow us to manage chair availability with minimal computational overhead.
- **Automatic Ordering**: With priority queues, we get both minimum chair numbering and earliest availability checks handled automatically, which would be cumbersome and slower with other data structures (like lists or arrays).
