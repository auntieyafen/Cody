The current solution for computing all possible results from different ways of adding parentheses to a mathematical expression is using a recursive divide-and-conquer approach. However, this leads to redundant computations, as the same subproblems (subexpressions) are evaluated multiple times, resulting in an exponential time complexity.

### Time Complexity Improvements:
1. **Memoization**: The main inefficiency comes from re-computing results for the same subexpression multiple times. To avoid this, we can store the results of subexpressions in a memoization table. By caching results, we can significantly reduce redundant calculations and bring the time complexity closer to polynomial.

### Optimized Code with Memoization:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<string, vector<int>> memo;
    
    vector<int> diffWaysToCompute(string expression) {
        // If the result is already computed for this expression, return it
        if (memo.find(expression) != memo.end()) {
            return memo[expression];
        }
        
        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < expression.size(); i++) {
            char c = expression[i];
            if (c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*') {
                // Split the expression into left and right subexpressions
                vector<int> left = diffWaysToCompute(expression.substr(0, i));
                vector<int> right = diffWaysToCompute(expression.substr(i + 1));
                
                // Combine the results from left and right subexpressions
                for (int l : left) {
                    for (int r : right) {
                        if (c == '+') {
                            res.push_back(l + r);
                        } else if (c == '-') {
                            res.push_back(l - r);
                        } else {
                            res.push_back(l * r);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If the result is a number and no operators were found, add the number
        if (res.empty()) {
            res.push_back(stoi(expression));
        }
        
        // Store the result in the memoization table
        memo[expression] = res;
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Memoization**: We use a hash map (`unordered_map<string, vector<int>> memo`) to store the result for each subexpression. This way, if we encounter the same subexpression again, we can directly use the cached result instead of recalculating it.

2. **Cache Lookup**: Before computing the result for any subexpression, we first check if it's already been computed and stored in the memoization table. If so, we return the cached result immediately.

3. **Storing Results**: Once the result for a given expression is computed, it is stored in the memoization table (`memo[expression] = res`) so that it can be reused later.

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- Without memoization, the time complexity is **O(3^n)** in the worst case, as for every operator, you split the expression into two subexpressions and recursively solve both parts.
- With memoization, the time complexity is reduced significantly. Each unique subexpression is computed only once, so the time complexity is closer to **O(n * k)**, where `n` is the length of the expression and `k` is the number of distinct subexpressions. The actual time complexity is tricky to calculate exactly, but it's much more efficient with memoization.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n * k)**: The memoization table stores results for each subexpression, where `n` is the length of the expression and `k` is the number of distinct subexpressions.

This optimization ensures that we compute each subexpression only once, thus reducing the overall time complexity.

--------------------


If the memoization didn't provide the expected improvement, then we can try optimizing further by avoiding repeated string operations like `substr`, which can be slow when used excessively. Instead, we can pass indices to work with substrings instead of creating new strings. This avoids copying parts of the string multiple times.

### Optimized Approach Using Indexes:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<string, vector<int>> memo;

    vector<int> diffWaysToCompute(const string& expression) {
        return compute(expression, 0, expression.size());
    }

private:
    vector<int> compute(const string& expression, int start, int end) {
        // Generate a unique key for memoization based on start and end indices
        string key = expression.substr(start, end - start);
        if (memo.find(key) != memo.end()) {
            return memo[key];
        }

        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
            char c = expression[i];
            if (c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*') {
                // Compute left and right parts without creating new substrings
                vector<int> left = compute(expression, start, i);
                vector<int> right = compute(expression, i + 1, end);

                for (int l : left) {
                    for (int r : right) {
                        if (c == '+') {
                            res.push_back(l + r);
                        } else if (c == '-') {
                            res.push_back(l - r);
                        } else {
                            res.push_back(l * r);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // If res is empty, it means the expression is a single number
        if (res.empty()) {
            res.push_back(stoi(expression.substr(start, end - start)));
        }

        memo[key] = res;
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Key Optimizations:
1. **Avoid Substring Creation**: Instead of creating new substrings using `expression.substr()`, which can be slow, we use start and end indices to represent a subexpression. This avoids unnecessary string copying.
   
2. **Memoization Using Indices**: The memoization key is based on the start and end indices, which ensures that each subexpression is computed only once.

### Time Complexity:
- We avoid the overhead of repeated `substr()` calls, which can save a significant amount of time, especially with large input strings.
- The time complexity remains **O(n * k)**, but removing the extra string operations can reduce the constant factor.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n * k)** for memoization storage, similar to the previous approach. However, by avoiding string copying, we reduce the space used by intermediate substrings.

This approach avoids redundant string operations and should be more efficient, especially for large inputs.
