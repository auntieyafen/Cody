The solution you provided is quite efficient for finding the `k`-th lexicographically smallest integer in the range `[1, n]`. It uses a greedy approach to navigate through the numbers as if they were represented in a prefix tree (trie). This approach has a logarithmic complexity relative to `n` because it doesn't need to generate or sort all the numbers but rather skips ahead using the number of steps between prefixes. 

Let’s break down why the solution is good:

### How it works:
1. **Trie-based Navigation**: Imagine all the numbers from `1` to `n` arranged in a lexicographical order. The numbers form a prefix tree (trie), where the root is empty and each level represents one more digit in the number.
   - For example, if `n = 13`, the tree would look like:
     ```
     1
     ├── 10
     ├── 11
     ├── 12
     └── 13
     2
     └── 3
     ```
2. **Skip Unnecessary Subtrees**: The algorithm calculates the size (number of nodes) of each subtree starting from a current prefix. If the number of nodes in the current subtree is smaller than `k`, it means that the `k`-th number is further down the tree, and we skip the entire subtree by moving to the next sibling.
3. **Zoom Into Subtrees**: If the current subtree contains more than `k` numbers, it means that the `k`-th number lies within this subtree, so we zoom into it by appending digits to the current number.
4. **Counting Steps**: The function `step` counts the number of integers that begin with the current prefix, which helps in determining whether we need to move to the next sibling or descend further into the tree.

### Optimization
This method is already optimized in terms of time complexity, as it skips over large portions of the search space by calculating the number of nodes in subtrees.

### Potential Minor Improvements
While the current solution is very efficient, here are some small potential improvements or considerations:

1. **Early Exit**: You could add an early exit condition if `k == 0`, which would prevent some unnecessary calculations.
2. **Variable Naming**: Changing variable names for better readability. For example, `step` can be renamed to `countInPrefix` to be more descriptive.
3. **Boundary Handling**: Make sure boundary conditions for `n` are properly handled, although the current solution seems to handle this well.

Here’s a slightly refactored version with improved readability:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthNumber(int n, int k) {
        int current = 1;  // Start from 1
        k--;  // Adjust because we are starting with the first number

        while (k > 0) {
            long long countInPrefix = 0;
            long long first = current, last = current + 1;

            // Calculate how many numbers exist with the current prefix
            while (first <= n) {
                countInPrefix += min((long long)n + 1, last) - first;
                first *= 10;
                last *= 10;
            }

            // If the current subtree contains fewer than k numbers, skip it
            if (countInPrefix <= k) {
                k -= countInPrefix;
                current++;
            } else {
                // If the k-th number is in the current subtree, go deeper
                k--;
                current *= 10;
            }
        }

        return current;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(log(n) * log(n))`, where each iteration either skips over a subtree or zooms into a deeper level of the tree. Since we're working with the number of digits and prefix size, the complexity is logarithmic with respect to `n`.

### Summary:
- This solution is highly optimized for large values of `n` and `k`, and it avoids the inefficiencies of generating or sorting all numbers in the range `[1, n]`. 
- Minor improvements for readability and early exits could be made, but the current structure is solid and efficient in terms of performance.
