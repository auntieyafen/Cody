The bug in your code lies in the way `ceil` is being applied to `tempMax / 3`. In integer division, `tempMax / 3` will truncate the decimal part, which may lead to an incorrect result if `tempMax` is not divisible by 3. You should perform floating-point division before applying `ceil`, like this: `ceil(tempMax / 3.0)`, so that `tempMax` is divided as a double rather than an integer.

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    long long maxKelements(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        long long maxK = 0;
        std::priority_queue<long long> heap(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            long long tempMax = heap.top();
            maxK += tempMax;
            std::cout << tempMax << std::endl;
            heap.pop();
            heap.push(std::ceil(tempMax / 3.0)); // Corrected to use 3.0 for floating-point division
        }
        
        return maxK;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Fix
- Changing `tempMax / 3` to `tempMax / 3.0` ensures that division is performed in floating-point arithmetic, allowing `ceil` to function as intended. This will correctly round up when `tempMax` is not divisible by 3.

### Example Debug Output
For `nums = [1, 10, 3, 3, 3]` and `k = 3`:
- The correct outputs at each step would show the maximum values being correctly reduced according to `ceil(tempMax / 3)`, which should match the expected output.

To improve the solution, we can use a **max-heap** (priority queue) to track the largest element efficiently, while minimizing the number of operations to access and update the max elements.

### Optimized Solution
Each iteration, instead of using `ceil` for integer division (which has overhead), we can directly compute the new values without converting to floating-point. Dividing by 3 and rounding up for integer values can be achieved by using the formula `(num + 2) / 3`. This is because integer division in C++ truncates towards zero, so adding 2 achieves the equivalent of rounding up.

Here's the optimized solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    long long maxKelements(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        long long maxK = 0;
        std::priority_queue<int> heap(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int maxElement = heap.top();
            maxK += maxElement;
            heap.pop();
            int reducedValue = (maxElement + 2) / 3;  // Equivalent to ceil(maxElement / 3.0) in integer math
            heap.push(reducedValue);
        }

        return maxK;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Heap Initialization**: Initialize the max-heap with the elements from `nums`, ensuring the largest element is always accessible in \(O(\log n)\) time complexity.
2. **Loop for `k` Operations**: For each of the `k` operations:
   - Pop the largest element from the heap, add it to `maxK`.
   - Calculate the "rounded-up division by 3" of the largest element using `(maxElement + 2) / 3`.
   - Push the modified value back into the heap.
3. **Return Result**: After `k` iterations, `maxK` contains the sum of the largest elements over `k` operations.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(k \log n)\), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. Each push and pop operation on the heap takes \(O(\log n)\), and we do it `k` times.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the max-heap.

This optimized approach is efficient and avoids unnecessary floating-point operations, making it faster for larger inputs.
