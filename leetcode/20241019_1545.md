The task involves constructing binary strings recursively using the following rules:

- **S1** is initialized as `"0"`.
- **Si** (for i > 1) is constructed as:
  - Take \( S_{i-1} \),
  - Append `"1"`,
  - Then append the reverse of the inverted version of \( S_{i-1} \).

We are given two integers, \( n \) and \( k \), and our goal is to find the k-th character (1-indexed) in the binary string \( S_n \).

### Approach:

#### 1. Understanding the Recursive Definition:
- **S1 = "0"**.
- **S2 = "0" + "1" + reverse(invert("0")) = "011"**.
- **S3 = "011" + "1" + reverse(invert("011")) = "0111001"**.
- And so on...

The string grows exponentially in length as \( S_i \) is constructed from \( S_{i-1} \).

#### 2. Observations:
- The binary string \( S_n \) is composed of three parts:
  - The first part is \( S_{n-1} \),
  - The middle part is `"1"`,
  - The last part is the reverse of the inverted \( S_{n-1} \).

Given this structure, we can determine the position of the k-th character by recursively breaking the problem into smaller subproblems based on which part of \( S_n \) the k-th character belongs to.

#### 3. Recursive Search:
Since constructing the full string for large \( n \) would be computationally expensive due to the exponential growth, a better approach is to figure out whether the k-th character lies in:
- The first part (which is \( S_{n-1} \)),
- The middle part (which is `"1"`), or
- The last part (which is the reverse of the inverted \( S_{n-1} \)).

Using this recursive breakdown, we can solve the problem efficiently.

#### Recursive Solution:

1. **Base Case:** If \( n = 1 \), the string is "0", so return '0' regardless of \( k \).

2. **Length Calculation:** The length of \( S_n \) is \( 2^n - 1 \). For example, the length of \( S_2 \) is 3, the length of \( S_3 \) is 7, and so on.

3. **Recursive Step:** For any \( S_n \):
   - If \( k \) is within the first half, recursively find the k-th character in \( S_{n-1} \).
   - If \( k \) is exactly the middle, return `"1"`.
   - If \( k \) is in the second half, recursively find the corresponding character in \( S_{n-1} \), but invert and reverse the result.

### Code Implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findKthBit(int n, int k) {
        // Helper function to recursively find the k-th bit
        return findBit(n, k);
    }

private:
    char findBit(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1) return '0'; // Base case, S1 is "0"

        int length = (1 << n) - 1; // Length of Sn is 2^n - 1
        int mid = length / 2 + 1;  // The middle index (1-based)

        if (k == mid) {
            return '1'; // If k is the middle element, return '1'
        } else if (k < mid) {
            return findBit(n - 1, k); // If k is in the first part, recurse on S_{n-1}
        } else {
            // If k is in the second part, find the corresponding bit in S_{n-1}, and invert it
            return invert(findBit(n - 1, length - k + 1));
        }
    }

    // Function to invert a bit ('0' -> '1' and '1' -> '0')
    char invert(char bit) {
        return bit == '0' ? '1' : '0';
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case:** 
   - If \( n = 1 \), return '0' because \( S1 = "0" \).
   
2. **Recursive Structure:** 
   - The length of \( S_n \) is \( 2^n - 1 \), and the middle position is \( (2^n - 1) / 2 + 1 \).
   - If \( k \) is in the first half, the k-th bit is the same as the k-th bit in \( S_{n-1} \).
   - If \( k \) is exactly in the middle, it is always '1'.
   - If \( k \) is in the second half, we map it to a position in the first half of \( S_{n-1} \), and invert the result.

3. **Time Complexity:** 
   - The time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the input size. Each recursive step cuts the problem size roughly in half, making the approach efficient.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 5 \)

- The length of \( S_3 \) is 7. The middle element is at position 4.
- \( k = 5 \) is in the second half, so we map it to \( 7 - 5 + 1 = 3 \) and look for the 3rd character in \( S_2 \).
- The length of \( S_2 \) is 3, and the middle element is at position 2.
- \( k = 3 \) is in the second half, so we map it to \( 3 - 3 + 1 = 1 \) and look for the 1st character in \( S_1 \), which is '0'.
- Invert '0' to get '1'.
- The result is '1'.

#### Example 2:
Input: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 11 \)

- The length of \( S_4 \) is 15. The middle element is at position 8.
- \( k = 11 \) is in the second half, so we map it to \( 15 - 11 + 1 = 5 \) and look for the 5th character in \( S_3 \).
- Similarly, as in the first example, this leads to finding '1' as the result.

This recursive strategy efficiently finds the k-th bit without constructing the entire string.
