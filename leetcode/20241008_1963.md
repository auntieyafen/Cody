The code calculates the minimum number of swaps required to balance a string `s` of square brackets. It uses a `balance` counter to track the net effect of opening (`[`) and closing (`]`) brackets as it iterates through the string. Here’s an explanation of the code:

### Code Explanation

1. **Variables**:
   - `n`: The length of the string `s`.
   - `balance`: Keeps track of the net balance between opening (`[`) and closing (`]`) brackets. 
   - `swaps`: Counts the number of swaps needed to keep `balance` non-negative (indicating a valid sequence of brackets at each step).

2. **Looping through `s`**:
   - For each character in `s`, it checks if it's an opening bracket (`[`):
     - If so, it increments `balance` by 1.
     - If it’s a closing bracket (`]`), it decrements `balance` by 1.
     - If `balance` goes below zero after a decrement, it means we have an excess of closing brackets that need balancing.
       - To fix this, it increments `swaps` by 1, resets `balance` to 1 (as if a swap had balanced the bracket sequence).

3. **Return**: After the loop, `swaps` will contain the minimum number of swaps required.

### Example Walkthrough

For a string `"[[]]]["`, the code works as follows:

- Initial values: `balance = 0`, `swaps = 0`.
- Iterates through each character:
  - `[` → `balance = 1`.
  - `[` → `balance = 2`.
  - `]` → `balance = 1`.
  - `]` → `balance = 0`.
  - `]` → `balance = -1` (increment `swaps` and set `balance = 1`).
  - `[` → `balance = 2`.

Final result: `swaps = 1`.

### Optimized Solution

The current solution is efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. However, a slight improvement in clarity and efficiency can be achieved by eliminating redundant conditions. Here’s a streamlined version of the solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(string s) {
        int balance = 0, swaps = 0;
        
        for (char c : s) {
            balance += (c == '[') ? 1 : -1;
            
            if (balance < 0) { // imbalance detected
                swaps++;
                balance = 1; // reset balance as if swapped
            }
        }
        
        return swaps;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Optimized Solution

- This version uses a single loop and a simplified condition:
  - It updates `balance` directly based on each character (`[` increases balance by 1, and `]` decreases it by 1).
  - When `balance` becomes negative, a swap is needed. It increments `swaps` and resets `balance` to 1.
  
This optimized solution provides the same functionality as the original but is slightly more concise and may be marginally faster due to fewer checks.
