For the given problem, you need to identify which users have logged transactions at least as many times as the threshold given.

### Explanation:

1. **Input Parsing:** The function `processLogs` takes a list of logs and a threshold.
2. **Transaction Count:** An unordered map is used to count transactions for each user.
3. **Log Processing:**
   - Each log is parsed to get the sender and receiver.
   - If the sender and receiver are different, the receiver's count is also incremented.
4. **Result Preparation:**
   - Users with transaction counts greater than or equal to the threshold are added to a vector.
   - The vector is then sorted numerically before returning.

### Test Case Example:

- Input logs: `["88 99 200", "88 99 300", "99 32 100", "12 15 1"]`
- Threshold: `2`
- The output should be `["88", "99"]` since users 88 and 99 have at least two transactions.
Yes, you can simplify string processing by using the `std::istringstream` class in C++ to split strings more easily. Here is an updated version of the code using `std::istringstream`:

### Changes Made:
1. **`std::istringstream` for Easier String Splitting:**
   - The `istringstream` class makes splitting strings straightforward without needing explicit loop logic.
   - It reads individual parts of the log separated by spaces directly into variables (`sender`, `receiver`, `amount`).
  
This approach simplifies the process of splitting the input strings, making the code easier to read and maintain.

`iss` is an instance of the `std::istringstream` class. `std::istringstream` is a part of the C++ Standard Library and provides a way to work with strings as if they were input streams (similar to reading from `cin`).

When you create an `istringstream` object like `iss`, you can use it to read individual parts of a string by using the extraction operator (`>>`). This is useful for splitting strings that contain space-separated elements, as it automatically handles whitespace and parses different components into variables. For example:

```cpp
istringstream iss(log);
string sender, receiver, amount;
iss >> sender >> receiver >> amount;
```

In the above code, `iss` extracts values from the string `log` and assigns them to `sender`, `receiver`, and `amount` respectively.

#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<pair<int, int>> ids = {{3, 100}, {1, 200}, {2, 300}};
sort(ids.begin(), ids.end(), [](const pair<int, int>& a, const pair<int, int>& b) {
    return a.first < b.first; // Sort by the first element (id) in ascending order
});
