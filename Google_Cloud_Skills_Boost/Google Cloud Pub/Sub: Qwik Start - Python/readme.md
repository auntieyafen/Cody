Task 1. Create a virtual environment
Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installation from the system.

Install the virtualenv environment:
sudo apt-get install -y virtualenv
Copied!
Build the virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv
Copied!
Activate the virtual environment.
source venv/bin/activate
Copied!
Task 2. Install the client library
Run the following to install the client library:
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-pubsub
Copied!
Get the sample code by cloning a GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/googleapis/python-pubsub.git
Copied!
Navigate to the directory:
cd python-pubsub/samples/snippets
Copied!
Task 3. Pub/Sub - the Basics
Google Cloud Pub/Sub is an asynchronous global messaging service. There are three terms in Pub/Sub that appear often: topics, publishing, and subscribing.

A topic is a shared string that allows applications to connect with one another through a common thread.

Publishers push (or publish) a message to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. Subscribers will then make a subscription to that thread, where they will either pull messages from the topic or configure webhooks for push subscriptions. Every subscriber must acknowledge each message within a configurable window of time.

In sum, a publisher creates and sends messages to a topic and a subscriber creates a subscription to a topic to receive messages from it.

Pub/Sub in Google CLoud
Pub/Sub comes preinstalled in the Cloud Shell, so there are no installations or configurations required to get started with this service. In this lab you use Python to create the topic, subscriber, and then view the message. You use a gcloud command to publish the message to the topic.

Task 4. Create a topic
To publish data to Cloud Pub/Sub you create a topic and then configure a publisher to the topic.

In Cloud Shell, your Project ID should automatically be stored in the environment variable GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT:
echo $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
Copied!
Ensure the output is the same as the Project ID in your CONNECTION DETAILS.
publisher.py is a script that demonstrates how to perform basic operations on topics with the Cloud Pub/Sub API. View the content of publisher script:

cat publisher.py
Copied!
Note: Alternatively, you can use the shell editors that are installed on Cloud Shell, such as nano or vim or use the Cloud Shell code editor to view python-pubsub/samples/snippets/publisher.py.
For information about the publisher script:
python publisher.py -h
Copied!
Example output:

usage: publisher.py [-h]
                    project
                    {list,create,delete,publish,publish-with-custom-attributes,publish-with-futures,publish-with-error-handler,publish-with-batch-settings}

gcloud pubsub topics publish MyTopic --message "Publisher's name is <YOUR NAME>"
Copied!
gcloud pubsub topics publish MyTopic --message "Publisher likes to eat <FOOD>"
